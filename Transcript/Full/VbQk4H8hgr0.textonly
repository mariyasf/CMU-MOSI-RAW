 welcome to this weeks movie review on Shrek the third starring Mike Myers Cameron Diaz and Abraham Shrek is already the second film that comes out as a sequel its the third installment of the series and we had Spirderman already and we had a ton of them coming up this summer and this is the one that I can say was definatelly disappointed I love the first Shrek and the second Shrek and I was really hoping that this one be just as good and it just that it hadnt anything new to offer I was really disappointed with that I mean I went in there hoping to see something original and funny like the first two and it offered nothing of the such it wasnt remotly funny there was a few jokes OK yeah make you giggle or something but thats nothing major nothing really that funny or anything original the characters are all the same and not even as good as the first two movies last ye the last Shrek that came out the second one introduces Puss in boots and I loved Puss in boots and he wasnt even that great this time around the donkey and puss in boots rivalry thats going on it just it wasnt as funny the third time around and there was nothing new to offer plain and simply it was dull for me it couldve been so much better I I couldve I saw it being so much better in my head but it just wasnt it disappointed me highly and I was just sort of discouraged after seeing the movie and Im definatelly wish I had my money back um it was a waste of my time and I dont suggest anyone go see it if youre hoping to if you have to have if you have kids and youre forced to go which you probably will if you have kids you know put up with it as a parent but on your own dont go see it its not really that great everyone is split on this one just as they were on Spiderman and just they are with all the other sequels that are coming out an this one I have to agree on the negative side it was not great it wasnt even remotely good I mean theres a few moments yeah that are original and funny and theres a ne an introduction of a new character Justine Timberlakes character already in the film but they didnt even give him that much to do the he had only few minor lines and none of them were really that great I mean stands out in your mind so the addition of this character was pretty pointless I mean its pleasent to the story but I still find it pointless in the end of the movie and the characters just werent the same as the first two that I fell in love with them it just kind of made me wanna really walk out of the theater to add to the problems I had a problem with the audio in my theater so that just pissed me off more but really I couldve shouldve just walked up and left at that moment it was boring and not at all original in my opinion it couldve been so much better than the second sequel was really great and I loved it and this one just was a flat of disappointments so Im gonna rate this one two stars it shouldve really be one but Im gonna give it a two to be fair because the movie did have some points when I was laughing but very few and it wasnt worth it in my opinion to go see it so I definatelly suggest
