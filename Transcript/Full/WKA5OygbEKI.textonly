 Hey Amber here Uh just doing a really quick review on my own Uh I really enjoyed doing them for the Philly D movie club so I thought oh why not I just went to the movies on Sunday so uh here is my review for uh Rango Uh Rango is a really cute movie about a chameleon that gets lost on the freeway somewhere down South And uh finds himself in a little town called Dirt that uh has a water problem and he ends up being their Sheriff because him being this uh big actor chameleon back in his own mind he basically convinces the town that hes tough and that hes hed be a really good Sheriff for the town and hell solve all of their water problems Um I I liked a lot of the movie I will admit Im a big Johnny Depp fan um I pretty much will go see any movie that kind of has an interesting plot if hes in it just to see if uh his his acting capabilities are are up to to par in it Um Its not his best Ive seen him in other cartoons I mean Corpse Bride hes really good in Corpse Bride and Rango kind of falls into that Well its a Johnny Depp movie so its entertaining but its not something that I would go buy or something I would recommend unless you have little kids to bring with you Um What else Oh it has some really good references of past Johnny Depp films in it Like while the chameleons getting bounced along the highway you run into Henry S Thompson Um He pulls out a lot of his voices in it Uh hes super entertaining as the chameleon I mean Johnny Depps a wonderful voice actor so um He hes I do hes an incredible voice actor Like thats really the best part of the movie is listening to him uh pull off all these different voices and be this really quirky little chameleon Um I I would yeah I would recommend it if you have little kids but if you dont really have any small friends Uh that sounded really perverted Small children that you are related to um to take to the movies uh I wouldnt go see it by myself I definitely will buy it but uh it was worth the free movie passes that I used on it um I will see you next time Im going to try to do a review on the book Children of the Men because I just finished that uh Make sure to check out the links below to my Twitter page and blog Uh my blog right now is currently only really book reviews but Im gonna try to integrate some of the movie reviews that Ive done in the past for the Philly D movie club into uh full written reviews as well So check those out theyre down in this section down there Um we will see you next time and thanks for listening to me ramble
