so i mean the title says it all for this movie battle for los angeles aliens invade they attack all the world and theyre coming but you dont know why and theyre just attacking from every point on the earth and its just a worldwide invasion and theyre about to takeover los angeles so and theres a plot with uh theres erin eckhart and his crew who are in la trying to stop the aliens alright so whats good about this movie the action is fucking awesome the action is really really well directed its very reminscent of district 9 its like someone watched the third act of district 9 a bunch of times like lets make this into an entire movie itll be awesome and thats pretty much what they did here but it didnt turn out quite nearly as awesome as that movie did in fact this movie isnt even on the same level as district 9 nor is it um for uh black hawk down which people are comparing it to i didnt really see a comparison to black hawk down until like the very very end but nevertheless another really cool thing about this movie the aliens are really awesome they designed the aliens in a really cool unique way to make them like biotic but also mechanical and they have really cool technology thats really interesting to watch like make them blow up shit and you know and they always like pull out something new but its not always quite explained you know like everything about the aliens but they give you a good amount of information about them like enough that it actually is a good reason why they why theyre attacking and it keeps your interests in the action scenes at least during this movie so and now we get to whats bad about this movie uh the dialogue is terrible there is no good dialogue nothing in this movie is cleverly written everything they say just sounds so fucking stupid the only actor who can really sell their lines is erin eckart there are moments where he says something youre like that just sounded dumb as hell but he totally sells it just to put this in perspective the last line of the movie goes like this erin eckhart gets asked something he turns hes like weve already had breakfast thats his last line like i mean im an actor but i kinda would have read that been like hm i mean schwarzanegger never said anything really that badass in his movies but arite and moving on theres no character development in this movie none the characters they tried to show a little something for them and people were telling me that this isnt that kind of a movie where theyre developing characters well i can tell you right now i dont remember the names of any characters none of them were memborable and they were all just really bland and forgettable and one o another big problem with this movie its two hours long okay at around right before the third act and it really gets action packed theres like
