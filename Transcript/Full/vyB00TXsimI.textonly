I appologize that I have been kind of neglecting movie reviews lately because things have been really really busy but I do wanna tell you about Priest Priest stars Paul Bettany Its based on a graphic novel and it is crazy basically priests are trained to kill vampires and they are super awesome they basically have super human abilities when it comes down to it if you were looking for a movie that has anything realistic in it you should not be looking at this movie because it is insane if you like explosions really ridiculous action sequences malodramatic plot and acting this is the right movie to see the premise is that Paul Bettanys character is contacted about the kidnapping of a young girl from a Wasteland community and he has a connection to this girl through family and he wants to get her back because he knows shes been kidnapped by vampires even though the church who is like big brother within the cities will not allow it and theyre denying the vampires continue to exist so off he goes breaks bonds with church goes out in search of the girl Maggy Cue is a priest and shes sent out after him and she also has pretty sweet moves and is fun to watch some really fun touches within the movie is that two vampires in other shows appear in this movie not as vampires one of them is Steven Moyer who you know as vampire Bill from True blood he plays the father of the kidnapped girl young fellow that plays sheriff Hicks was the vampire that kidnapped Bella in the first Twilight movie and he is helping look for the kidnapped girl as well therere also two Lord of the rings grads which I absolutely love and anyone who knows me knows the Lord of the rings trilogy is probably my favorite movie ever if all three of them were put together yeah thats about how my favorite list goes but Carl Urban plays Black hat Black hat is a former priest and Brad Durraff who was Wormtongue in the Lord of the rings serie plays salesman which basically means hes Wormtongue again in a different way other notable mentiones are Christopher Plumber plays the monk senior whos like the head of the church and Lily Collins plays Lucy the kidnapped girl and she is a really pretty girl the last time we saw her was probably in the blind side this is one of my favorite types of movies I really love the melodramatic over the top crazy action sort of thing going on theres s scene in a cave where they fight a giant monster that really reminds me of like some sort of Lord of the Rings mines of moria moment and theres a better on top of the train fights than the first mission impossible movie so yes I really enjoyed it I thought it was fun and I enjoyed myself a lot at the movie I laughed at quite a bit of the dialogue and there actually was one scene that I found kin
