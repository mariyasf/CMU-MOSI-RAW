 Moli Elfman coming to you with the review for Red State probably one of the ballsiest probably one of the ballsiest fims od Sundance 2011 Um as really the best way to describe this film is its big its bold its strong it makes big powerfuls statements it doesnt hold back everything from the way its being released to the performances and to the story itself is absolutely ovrt the top impressive and really well done Its a huge break through for Kevin Smith Its completely different from anything weve ever seen him do before John Goodman absolutely amazing Melissa Leo will have you creeped out to your inner core with her tiny little smile Its so well done For all of those people who are hating on it I dont know what they are complaining about it Its a horror film ia a true sense and it is absolutely horrifying Um it is it is definately one of those films thats not gonna be easy for you to find Its being released in a very interesting way Whenever it comes to your town do not miss it Its extremly well made its extremly dare I say fun to watch in a really messed up kind of way and even now its a horror film its definately got some fun Kevin Smith moments in it for you to laugh with um Yeap absolutely not to be missed
