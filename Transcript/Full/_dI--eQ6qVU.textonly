 Hello hello I like coming too here and I wanna give you guys a review of the Green Hornet movie I was lucky enough to snag passes to the advanced screening of the Green Hornet here in New York City The movies isnt actually released till January but I got a sneak peek Just like the Spiderman play that Ive recently reviewed it is not in its final form the people that worked on the movie were there at the screening and they said they might still tweet a couple of things before the movie comes out But I can safely assure you that even if they didnt it would still be a hit I knew nothing about the Green Hornet going into this even though Im a comic fan I havent had the time to pick up the Green Hornet Or listen to the radio program or anything like that so I came with the fresh view I had no idea about anything and I loved it I dont know if fans of the comic would be as inclined to say the same because I dont know how much it differs from the comic or radio program that people like so much but just going into this a as an observer and someone who has no idea it was a fantastic film it was so much fun and I would tell you right now it was hilarious It was really really funny Seth Rogen plays the Green Hornet and most of you know hes a pretty funny guy and he funnied up this movie big time totally He had a hand in writing the skript I think I saw on the credits so that doesnt surprise me and the humor it was kind of necessary I feel like if they woudlnt have inserted the humor into this movie it wouldve been just too serious and kind of boring in a sense but the humor really just nailed it and the action sequences in this movie are tensed I love when people do this when they just come up with these totally completely new stylized ways of developing action sequences coz sure its fun to see a super hero go round and kick bad guy butt you know punch kick whatever bam but when they figure out a new way to interpret this and add something like an extra spark in there that makes it more visually truly appealing and just different it engages the audience more and I just really enjoyed it Just like Scott Pilgrim employed that kind of sound effect in text and that kind of video game mask quality The Green Hornet did something similar but they took a new spin on it and I just loved it And I feel like even though the fighting sequences were a little bit long in some places t we did see it in 2D and the movie is gonna be released in 3D so I meant if I was wearing 3D glasses and was seeing this in 3D I wouldve enjoyed it a lot more and I would want the sequences to be even longer rather than shorter So the premise of this movie that there is this guy who has a very rich father whose father dies he inherits his money he decides to become a villain of the night sort of speak and fight crime and clean up his city with a sidekick
