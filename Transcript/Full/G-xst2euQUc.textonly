Hey guys I have a very short movie review for you Last night I went to see the movie Rio which is the animated movie um it is um produced by the same company um that produced the I Iceage movies um and in that respect it very similar starts up with the baby a lot of those movies produced by that company tend to start up with baby animals to tug at the heart strenghts although I think Iceage started up with the baby human yeah anywayit was a really cute movie I did not think I was gonna like it I really didnt wanna go see it um Ill tell you why they start up pushing that movie at least 6 months ago in the theaters and trailers and it seems to me than when production companies start pushing movies that far ahead and when they were gonna be released that usaually means that they are not gonna be great and I was pleasantly surprised by this movie I was I thoroughly enjoyed it um this is a great family movie to take your whole family to this movie its great for all ages um I thought the story line was really cute and again it does really tug at the heart strenghts with the little baby animals at the beginning um it has it has a very predictable story that so what is still a really great movie to take your whole family to um I thought that the actors who did the voices and Ill list all of those in the information box because I dont really remember who all of them were Anne Hathaway that sticks out of my mind and um Eisenberg um whats his first name I dont know but he did the voice of the main character Anne Hathaway did the voice of his love interest and I dont know if Anne Hathaway did the singing theres a little bit of singing in this movie but if it was Anne Hathaway who did the singing she did a great job I had no idea that Anne Hathaway could really sing If thats her singing anyway um I would recommend it if if youre like me and you dont normally go to see animated movies and Im Im not really in a big hurry at my age to go see animated movies um but there really hasnt been much to has come out this year so far that Im dying to go see and we really wanted to get out of the house um last night Yesterday was Easter so we went to the theater and that was showing um and so we did go to see it and I was thoroughly um surprised at how much I really did enjoy it So I would recommend this movie um anyway thanks for watchingyou guys have a great day bye
