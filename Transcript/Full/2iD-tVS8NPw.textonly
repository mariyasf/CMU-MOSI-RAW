hey welcome to stuffwelikecom video review of the Green Lantern stuff we like before I went in to see the Green Lantern Ive been hearing all these like critics basically just trashing this movie left and right I wasnt entirely sure why exactly I didnt read what they had written about the Green lantern and what they overall their thoughts were on this movie and still I I Ive yet to as of this review but I at the same time I do wanna just say that I enjoyed this movie I enjoyed it for what it was you know its a huge sort of spectacle movie that is great for this summer time you know this is a movie that youre gonna go out and see and you wanna see it in 3D because I I would actually say this probably is one of the first movies this year that Ive seen this year that you wanna see in 3D especially for just the opening portion it looks really good and the rest of it does look good as well and I just had fun watching this movie its not like a dark movie or anything its very much a light hearted so its perfect for kids as well as just like teenagers as well who just wanna see a lot of explosions and some crazy stuff and you know going into it or these watching the trailers before head I was really kind of hesitant about seeing the Green lantern in the first place because it looks like a cartoon Im not really a huge fan of having like all these 3D characters because I think why not just make this you know movie this live action movie and talk cartoon thats really the route that youre gonna go and it seemed like they were gonna go that route but I think there was also some sort of like um tone within the actual um powers of the green lantern and himself and that you can basically think up of anything and you can project that into the real life and I think having this sort of superpower almost this power to just imagine anything kind of just um helped me get passed that you know these are all CGI characters and set this is a playground and their imaginary playground and anything can happen anything that what also made the film exciting because you dont entirely know whats coming next the entire movie is about building up towards this ultimate battle of this force that is so powerful and they dont even know how to defeat it its that powerful you know its the darkest force ever right but then you kind of like walk out of the movie and youre like well I I get what happened I understand what happened but what what would you do for Green Lantern movie 2 that would be even like worth while now because I mean if hes able to do all of this sort of stuff like how youre supposed to really put up a force that can push him to the next level or or destroy him at the same time during the credit sequence they do have a scene that basically explains what potentially speaking the Green lantern 2 might be about and it does kind of a lea helps alleviate what that whole was is about fighting the ultimate enemy within this first movie and that the threat is still there potentially speaking so its kind of interesting to see um where theyre gonna be going with that Im looking forward to it Ive got to say its not like the Green lantern is the next Batman begins or or the Dark nighter
