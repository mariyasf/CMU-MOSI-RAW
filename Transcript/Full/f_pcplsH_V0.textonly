 I just want you all to know that just do we dont have to delay this review until Saturday i drove an hour each way to catch a midnight showing of this movie so you better appreciate this review i know the majority of the people who watch my reviews arent actually my subscribers but to any of you who are i expect a thumbs up got it but anyway lets start with the obvious who the killer was or killers theyre back to you having two killers thankfully because it does make a lot more sense having the killer be able to be everywhere if theres two of them okay first off here were the two guys in the trailer who were laying out the rules the assistant killer basically was the one with the long hair not the one with the camera hes killed and the main killer was Sidneys cousin Jill who was tired of living in Sidneys shadow and has decided to stage a remake of the original movie in which she can take Sidneys place at the end and so her basic goal is reenact the original movie only upping the ante on every single scene exactly as modern remakes do hmph my overall opinion of the results of this process are its better than Scream 3 and actually is better than Scream 2 a lot of people dont like scream 2 i think its highly underrated i hated Scream 3 but i think this one did beat Scream 2 Now i didnt really like the first hour that much though im sure you all remember the stab movies that were based on the scream movies or the experiences of Sidney in universe so that people could comment on the killers reenacting the movies or following up the movies well in the first hour those become way way way too much of a plot point basically theres now seven of them the fifth one apparently features time travel i think xxx i want to see it but anyway but it actually basically makes the characters congition not just of the genre within which they are in but of their own franchise to a ridiculous extent Im just kinda like no this is going to far there are only 3 scream movies
