 written by nicholas sparks and directed by judy ann robinson the last song starrs miley cyrus greg coullier and liam hensworth and its about a rebellious girl who is sent for the summer um to her father who lives in a southern city and through their love of music they begin to reconnect now i am a huge HUGE fan of nicholas sparks um the notebook is one of my favorite films um i really enjoyed a walk to remember me and dear john and which is his most recent one i really did enjoy as well wasnt too fond of the ending but thats for another another review so i went into this film having quite high expectations i mean its a nicholas sparks book it must be good but on the other hand i was really um wary of going like what to expect from miley cyrus um i mean shes only done the hannah montana franchise playing that one character which i think like 99 of the percent of the time her characters like so overboard shes so exaggerated so i really didnt know how she was going to handle this film straight away miley cyrus acting miley cyrus acting or lack of she had this same expression throughout the entire film it was like this like pouty like grumpy look and then maybe even when she was happy like she wouldnt frown her um frown her eyebrows but shed still be pouty but like yeah like that which just uh it REALLY annoyed me like those tho those those moments in the film especially in the beginning where she would sit there stand there cross um with her arms crossed and just look out into the distance like just laughing with the same expression or shed look across the beach or shed look at her dad or shed look at her brother with the same expression and i was just like whatre you thinking i i dont understand what this characters doing like okay shes staring whats she thinking how does she feel i had no idea like it was the same expression for shock or for sadness or what i presumed shed be sad but it sigh it really bugged me smacking lips and another thing that i read um in this magazine or had an interview was that she said she hadnt even read the novel i mean i havent read the novel so i cant really say anything but as an actor i really think especially an actor in the lead leading role you really should prepare for that role i was like how can you go into a film into a leading role and have no idea who your character is smacking so thats probably why she just laughinglooked the same in every single scene there was probably about two scenes that i actually thought yea she this is her acting this is good she can do this but then those two moments just got ruined by the rest of an hour and a half of her being pouty um however not all
