 Hi everybody my name is Anthony Aranda from Kids first I just got finished watching an excellent movie called Mars Needs Moms This movie is all about Milo who goes on a big adventure to help his mother to get away from the alians And the alians arent really good mothers so thats why they looked down on at Earth to find good mothers to take care of the alian siblings And my favorite characters in the movie would have to be Milo Milos mother and Gribble I liked Gribble because he helped Milo get Milos mother away from the alians Which I thought was awesome And my favorite part in the movie was when Milo has to save Gribble Because the alians in the uniforms were gonna shoot Gribble And when they were about to shoot Gribble Milo came in swung in and then saved the day And the there are some bad people in this movie and that is the alians and the uniforms They are bad because they listen to the Supervisor The Supervisor wants everything around here She dosent care about enything enyone ever says And I would recommend this movie for ages 3 and up because it is a good movie and it depends what age you are and how you to how you feel like see the movie Like for example my brother is five years old and he didnt think this movie was scary at all I am eight years old and I thought it was really s kind of scary And that was my example And I think I why I would be scared is because I would feel scared and kind of sad if I lost my own mother But it all turns out great in the end Go out and see this movie when it premiers on Disney DVD Oops it looks I got done Bye
