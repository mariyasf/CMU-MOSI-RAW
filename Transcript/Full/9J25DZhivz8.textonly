 hey internet I saw Despicable me last night in XD or real D 3D however you wanna call it this movie is adorable the plot of Despicable me follows Gru an evil villain who has kind of being slipping as he gets older only able to pull off minor highs and steals and hes getting showing up by um bigger and newer villains so his next plan is to steal the Moon unfortunatelly a new evil nemesis has stolen the shrink ray which he needs to steal the Moon so Gru uses or adopts three little girls to help infiltrate his nemesiss fortress to steal the shrink ray the plan gets side tracked when Gru actually starts caring about these youngsters as more than just part of his evil plot this movie is just too adorable there were some really good things about this movie the voice acting excellent the visuals were great this was probably the best 3D movie Ive seen in a long time coz it actually used 3D Toy Story had elements of it but this movie played with 3D and um different ways to come at you out of the screen so I liked that a lot the voice acting in this was incredible Steve Carell voices Gru and Russell Brand actually really impressed me with his old man voice for the doctor of I couldnt I couldnt even believe it was Russell Brand I kept I was listening bored and there was maybe one time when I thought I actually heard Russell Brand himself but otherwise I thought he was excellent as for 3D I say yes theres one scene in this movie that makes 3D entirely worth it and thats when theyre in the amusement park and some people might think that theres a lot of cheap tricks but theres a roller coaster scene and if you are um get a little bit motion sick you might not wanna see it in 3D because youll feel like youre on this coaster I mean my stomach was almost going wohu as we went down the big drop I thought it was really cool that was a great effect there was a lot of cheap child humour which everyone can relate to and I I always think thats hilarious but what made this movie really fun was some of the adult humour jabs for instance semispoiler when Gru goes into the bank and the evil part of the bank to get a loan
