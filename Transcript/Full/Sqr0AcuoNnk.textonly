hi guys i just saw the movie friends with benefits and im going to review it for you i took some notes so im gonna read what i wrote down i guess before i get into specifics um ill just say like the basic um overall thoughts on the movie i dont really know i dont its so weird i there were times in the movie where i felt really bored and there were times that i thought it was funny and there were times that i was just sitting there after they said their jokes and i was like thats not nobodys laughing thats not funny i just dont think it was very good and this is the thing friends with benefits and no strings attached they are the same movie different ways of getting to the same point but its the same point so i think that no strings attached was better than friends with benefits i was not bored during no strings attached i thought it was very funny um and uh friends with benefits had its moments butsigh it had a lot of really bad moments i dont know im gonna im gonna go through the things that i wrote down and well see if i can give any more information on this richard jenkins is in this movie and he is one of my favorite actors ever he is brilliant there is not a movie that i see him in that i dont end up crying because he is so fantastic and he just breaks your heart whenever he does you know a role that usually his roles do break your heart at some point so definitely did in this movie i like teared up in friends with benefits because of him the lady who plays justin timberlakes sister um i thought she was very good in this movie and i thought she was just like really natural and funny and she looks like renee zellwegger and helen hunt from a twister movie and she talks like her too does anybody else like if youve seen it dont you think that she talks exactly like her it was weird the whole time i saw her all i thought was helen hunt and renee zellwegger another thing was the fact that there was not one healthy relationship or positive good relationship in this whole movie his sister and her son lived with his dad his his mom left his dad and him years ago and now his sister who isnt married and has a son who doesnt have a dad lives with the dad the son is ashamed of his dad then milas mom or whatever her name is jamies mom is an awful mother she doesnt even know who her dad is so its like and then they have a together they have an awful relationship so its like i dont know when i was watching it i was like people like their lives are awful like if you ever think about it maybe im looking too much into it but thats kind of depressing another thing that kind of is like to me if you do this thing that im gonna talk about right now it sort of is like you know that your movie is gonna
