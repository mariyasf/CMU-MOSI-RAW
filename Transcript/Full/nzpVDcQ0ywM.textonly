 this movie is directed by steven summers whose claim to fame is the mummy franchise and he really seems to be channeling michael bay in this movie the plot has the consistency of swiss cheese and its really glossed over with lots of stunning special effects and big explosions sigh all in all its kind of a disappointment to any of us who grew up in the 80s and are used to the toys in the cartoon i feel like it almost should have had a g rating it was really kind of dumb down for us and i hate to say that i think you will really LOVE this movie if you are 8 but if you are a child who grew up in that time period youre not going to enjoy this movie very much because they arent playing to you theyre playing to a new audience of kids who dont know anything about these characters in the first place the plot involves some tiny little machines sometime in the future that can destroy cancer cells and have become weaponized and bad people are trying to steal the warheads and so a government secret group called gi Joe is trying to protect them from the bad guys channing tatum is the lead he starrs as duke hes from the step up movies i guess which i havent seen and all i can is hes a pretty average guy i dont really feel any emotional pull from him in this movie even a scene where he proposes to his girlfriend in a flashback he barely bats an eye his best friend is played by marlon mayans he plays rip cord marlon wayans kind of plays a watered down version of himself from other movies he does some stereotypical things like talking uh about busting a cap while flying an airplane but otherwise hes just there to be the best friend and hes pretty average too the two women in this movie are particularly good looking and they kick a lot of butt uh sienna miller and rachel nickols one on each side there and they kick each others butt they kick other peoples butt and so thats pretty entertaining this is a really big movie for their careers because i havent really seen them in a lot of big movies other notable mentions dennis quaid plays hawk leader of the gi joes and his performance is campy and comes off as an army cheerleader some of the time laughing jonathan price is the president he is average brendan frasier shows up in a cameo for a training montage and its sh so short lived he barely needs to even be there uh stormshadow is very cool his fight sequences are very neat and he delivers a lot of intensity snake eyes you never see his face but it turns out he is played by the guy who played toad in the first xmen movie and he also kicks a lot of butt he never gives up the villain
