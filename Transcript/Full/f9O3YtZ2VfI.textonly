 good evening friends this video was originally supposed to be Alfred Hitchcok Psycho versus the Curious case of Benjamin Button but I decided to do away of that crap so its just gonna be a review of Benjamin Button and the Curious Case of Benjamin Button what whatever the name is too long the curious case of Benjamin Button is a David Finchers film starring Brad Pitt as a man who was born old and grows progresivly younger as he grows older its a very interesting idea and its they looked like it had a good core but hm it just too many problems with it the first problem is that its all told in flashback from a point just before Katrina hits New Orleans I didnt need any of that crap I dont need it all told in flashback I dont need the added element of Katrina it dosent it just its too much crap in here the the movies is too long they just need to cut that out another thing is we dont need his entire life th we do not need the entire span birth to death just give me a nice interesting choke and scale it down on like two hours this also falls in to the trandy is very popular these days if you do a whole all of CGI um and if youre gonna do mostly CGI just make an animated movie this looks like it just has a polyurethane coating on it makes him look too too good but dont get me wrong its not all bad its got my two favorite acresses in it Tilda Swinton and Cate Blanchett like I said before Is a very interesting idea and they did a lot of good things with it but its its like someone made you a kick ass sandwich but they put mayonnaise on it and you dont like mayonnaise and its not like tomato or lettuce where you can pick it off no its got it mayonnaise in its all over everything and now youre stuck with this kick ass sandwich that would be kick ass if it didnt have mayonnaise on it but it has mayonnaise on it or you go make another sandwich go make another sandwich this movie is just not quite good enough I really liked David Finch I liked all the um I like the cast but and its a good story but clap huh its a pass my neighbor probably thinks Im crazy yelling about movies to a camera
