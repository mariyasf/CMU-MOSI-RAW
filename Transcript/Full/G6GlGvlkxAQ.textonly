I wanna give you guys a quick spoiler free review of the movie summer blockbuster I would put money on it that it is going to be the blockbuster hit of the summer in terms of when you look at all the movies I Im a cap guy Captain america fan I think that would do very well but Thor just look at the numbers what it did last night it did three point um two five million just on midnight shows alone over on the opening night I just saw report from Friday the first two days were out um in the lot of theaters had when you look at the imax in 3D and 2D um so I think Thor is really gonna do well I think its gonna catapult Chris Hemsworth to be even a bigger star um I know he already did a remake of Red Dawn um great 80s movie for those who havent seen it originally with Patrick Swayze and Charlie Sheen by the way Charlie Sheen was winning there and hes winning no um and they actually moved Red dawn back to later this year so they could um um kind of get a little bit of Chris Hemsworth star power into that um great movie overall they did very well to establish the character of Thor the problem with a lot of comic book shows and movies and you saw this with the NBC recent flop of the Cape which is a show I love but the audience that was watching it they needed they needed a pay off right away and they needed character established right away um what you get in the sitcoms in terms of comic books and kind of the movies that take so loud to build that and why is this person wearing tights or why are they carrying a hammer you know why what is their mission or why why are they here you have to establsih that fairly quickly and I think that directors of Thor and the script writers did that right away you saw Thor for how hes in the comics pompous an arogant individual you saw what happens to him you saw how he ends up on Earth um but they also did a great job in building the backstory of Jane Foster played by Natalie Portman and her crew and how they relate to Thor so I think that was really good they didnt belabored Thor on Earth he sounded like he didnt learn from the earthlings um if if you are true Marvel comic fan you know that Thor in the comics thinks hes better because hes a god you know he always makes comments like oh gama radiation can hurt you it cant hurt us guardians were gods and hes right about that so he gets to he gets to Earth and see what happens there all while youre seeing whats going on with xxx and Loki and I think there was another great thing um this is not a spoiler but Marvel has already publicly announced that Loki will be the main bad guy in the adventures which makes sense because if you go back in adventures lower youll see that Loki was originally the reason why the adventures hat to be put together um so that makes sense um so they established Loki the established the relationshop between Thor Loki and Odin um they go back until some of Loki history that would only hard core comic fans know um huh Sif um and um Im forgetting the guy with the red beard I forget his name um um their group they establish they establish everything um they get the Earth you get other whole shield involvement which is cool to see that a lot of cooler references that at one point they reference Im a doctor with gama radiation um which are those moral fans ot all the trouble Petty Gross who was played by Liv Tyler in the Incredible Hulk movie a couple of years ago the refer
