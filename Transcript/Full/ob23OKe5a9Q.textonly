 hi my name is lily and today im gonna be giving a movie review over the smurfs i saw it um a few nights ago and i decided hm im gonna come and review it but it was a good movie id give it three stars only because it was very predictable very predictable not gonna give any like spoilers but very predictable um i saw it last night with my aunt and her boyfriend im not supposed to tell anyone that she brought her boyfriend cuz no one ever erase the last thing i just said that would be great that um i guess the only other problem i had with it was that um the jokes were really cheesy i dont like cheesy jokes but cheesy jokes are most times funny cuz theyre really bad so if thats the case then you should see this movie if you really like cheesy jokes predictable movies but other than that it was a perfect family movie i would definitely take 8 or younger kids to that movie its a definite family movie beyond this age the problem i had with the movie theatre is there were kids crying the whole time and whispering xxx does baby crying get on your nerves ever if it does wouldnt recommend going to this movie cuz theres a bunch of kids or sneak into a really late showing cuz i dont think kids are going to be out that late but thats the only problem i had with it other than that it was a good movie it was cute you know the actors did a great job bringing the smurfs to life such as joe george lopez neil patrick harris katy perry and a fourth it was a great movie and i loved it but i had a few problems so i didnt love it i liked it three stars for smurfs and stay smurfy everyone
