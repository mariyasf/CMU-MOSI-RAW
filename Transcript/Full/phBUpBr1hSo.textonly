hey Mr xxx review here for um Transformers Dark side of the moon also known as Transformers 3 I went to this movie very very excited Im a big Transformers fan I think um the movies are phenomenal especially that first one um I dont think that this ove got as much buzz and as much um media attention and um word of mouth you know spreading around and stuff I didnt see basically any commercials on TV for it Im a big internet guy so I saw a lot of stuff on the internet but um didnt see as much as I did for the second and the first one um in interviews Shia LaBeouf said that the second movie lacked um heart and he said that this new one has a lot of heart um similar to the first one um after watching this movie I dont really think thats necessarily true um I think that the second movie and the third movie are very very similar um I think they tried to add a lot of heart I mean hes got this new girlfriend obviously Megan Foxx was fired so hes got this new girlfriend and it just seems like too much too fast I mean theyre already telling each other that love each other and talking about getting wedding rings spending the rest of their lives together they live together I mean its just way too much too fast they try to built their heart into it by you know him saying you know youre the only thing that matters in this world you know I dont care about myself you know coz she thinks hes doing crazy stuff sacrifizing his life in a then he does crazy stuff to save her and hes just like I love you you know just all the sappy blah blah stuff theres too much too fast I mean we basically just get introduced to this character and you know right away um this is the first movie shes in and theyre already um you know um meant to be together forever and all that good slushy stuff this movie seemed um a little long I love my movies to be long um I dont think a movie can ever be too long um you know I like you know the dark night was you know two hours and forty five minutes you know and TItanic you know all those movies a Avatar all those movies that you know three hours and you know thats fine by me I love long movies um Im passionate about movies so thats fine but this one seemed long at some at some parts some parts just kind of dragged on you kind of you know sit in the movie theater and this is a big action movie one of the biggest movies of the summer and you kind of just wanted to you know rest your head while watched um coz some of the sequences and some of the scenes were just kind of long and you just kind of like OK lets get to it we know whats gonna happen lets go ahead and do it um the action was great you know not too much not too little just um just enough action um the story was all right but pretty good script I dont think it was as good as the first one obviously I I think the first movie was just fantastic um maybe Im part with the second one maybe Im little behind that but it was it was pretty good story the cast of this movie um its pretty huge um of course all the returning stars and than you know youve got people coming in they werent in the original movies um Ken Jeong I think his name is um and obviously that Chinese th
