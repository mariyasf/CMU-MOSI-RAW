Hey guys the first film I wanted to talk about is the new Winnie the Pooh movie It came out a couple of weeks ago a went to see it just because as a little kid my parents would would show me the many adventures of Winnie the Pooh and those little um that film came out in 1977 and it was a Vignette various Pooh adventures based on the books um and I never went to see Tiggers big move or Piglets big move in a Tigger movie and Pooh and a Heffalumps or whatever the other film was in the early 2000s but I went to this one coz when I saw the trailer it remainded me of the original film and and so I was kind of curious to see maybe if that was what Disney was going for and it definately was what thay were going for um I havent seen the 1977th film Vignettes for a while but I bet if you put them next to the new film that the style would be similar enough that you wouldnt be able to really tell what the difference is um its its great if you remember that was old films would be great for kids too the story is pretty simple weve got great jokes um funny jokes that the kids would get um I love the scene where Eeyore and Pooh think that Owl is getting sick because he says issue and they think he is saying at you um that was probably part of the trailer that got me to go and see the movie beacuse I wanted to see how they could frame that so um if you havent seen Winnie the Pooh and you like family films go see it Its a great one I definately recommend it So more next time See ya
