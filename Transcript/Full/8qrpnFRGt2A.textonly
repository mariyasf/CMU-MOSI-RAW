the instant watch and um I have to admit I was watching this I purposly put it on because I figured it would be something that would be stupid that I could fall asleep in the middle of and not miss too much coz it was late at night I was tired just wanted something to watch while I was falling asleep so I didnt didnt have very high expectations for this movie and I um pretty much it pretty much met my low expectations for the most part because I three major complaints I have about this movie um biggest one is the CGI effects were just terrible and um the story was pretty weird um and again I I if I had to pay closer attention I might have followed it more and might have been it might have made more sense um um this movie this movie um by half way through I was checking the time and saw that this movie was two hours long which I mean for a movie about JI Joe ninty minutes is enough Ok I dont need a three hour mini xxx about JI Joe but thats just me I thought that two hours was way too long for this movie and the last big thing was um just the the it it I know its about JIJOe you know obviously its gonna be about the army but it just felt like um like um military propaganda kind of like you know it fell like I was watching one of those army of one commercials sometimes um um but I can understand that I mean its about the army even if its a um you know fantacy version of the army of course its too much of course its gonna be making them look good just fine I I guess um but the funny thing is um I mean funny thing is despite as despite everything bad about this movie I ended up half way liking it and thats because about half way through the movie I realized that this is just its really just a cartoon if you look at it as a live action movie you youre gonna be disappointed but if you look at it as a cartoon which is pretty much mostly is with all the CGI FX and and there is a lot of it I mean this movie makes um makes um Star wars pretty close I mean its its about that level star war is pretty close as far as just CGI heavy like this time its what its like human face and everything around that face is cartoon CGI computer effects
