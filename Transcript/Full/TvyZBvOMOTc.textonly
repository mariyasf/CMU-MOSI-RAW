 Leap Year is a romantic comedy about a woman who flies to Ireland to propose to her boyfriend on Leap Day Which would have been a better name for the movie Unfortunately the plane lands on the other side of Ireland and she has to acquire an Irishman to get her to Dublin As they race against the clock many small problems arise to complicate their journey I rented the movie Leap Year a a few weeks ago with my friends and I really enjoyed it The countryside which they showed while going across Ireland was astoundingly ble beautiful And in the scene with the destroyed castle it really reminded me why I want to go there so badly Although I enjoyed the movie if I think about it honestly the plot wasnt that great Its a fun chick flick but other than that it doesnt really hold up under inspection lip smacking All the problems that come to stop them from getting to their destination are although plausible a little weak Even though the whole movie is based on whether she gets to Dublin in time youre never really worried about it because you know she gets there Lip Smakcing A lot of this movie brings a cute laugh here and there And both the actors Amy Adams and Matthew Goode work well with each other and seem to be really enjoying themselves the whole way through Even when theyre fighting in the movie though it just seems like its their banter not actual dislike All in all if youre looking for a cute romantic comedy with a beautiful setting then this will probably be a good movie for you
