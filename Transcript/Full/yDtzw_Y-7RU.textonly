and i saw this movie just last night here is my review so much to say about this film but let me first say this i liked it more than i expected i would that said lets hit it this film is slavishly devoted to the original book or nov novella uh by uh charles dickens the language the words i mean the script comes directly from uh charles dickens original writing that means a lot of things number one it means its much scarier than you could imagine my 8 year old was terrified through part of this because the original version is terrifying uh number two ive heard a couple people talk about the christianity of this film let me say this if your christianity is extremely legalistic this is the film for you cause this is a film that basically says you know what you should do you should take care of poor people because jesus told us to take care of poor people and if you dont take care of poor people youre gonna burn in hell so laughing if thats your form of christianity its a christian film um its not my form so do with that as you please um another thing about this film is in its devotion is that sometimes my children could not understand what was being said because they were speaking dickensonian english sometimes i missed what was being said uh another thing is that charles dickens was making real social commentary on victorian england of his day therefore a lot of social commentary goes woop sound effect over your head or just really doesnt make any difference to us today at all um all this stuff about debtors prison for instance doesnt really um jive here in 21st century america now the animation of the film the thing about disney is that disney makes amusement park rides and this film is this amazing like i say slavish devotion to charles dickens with an amusement park ride it involved because this thing is is meant to be seen in 3D which i saw it in and throughout the film youre going sound effects laughing either from the terrifying characters or most likely from going very quickly through london with you know demon horses chasing you so uh theres that also about the animation the people just like in polar express a film i really did not like um the people seemed sort of dead you know everyones like yes welcome to the polar express except their eyes are kind of like this welcome to the polar express whatever now all those things being said and thats a lot to be said for a one minute review i actually like the film um i enjoyed myself in it you might as well i would not take a young child
