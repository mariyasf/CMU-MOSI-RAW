 Hey everybody hope youre having a great day and here is a quick review on Zookeeper Save your money wait til it comes out on rental For me it was a waste of time There were a few funny lines but after an hour I just said enough I had to walk out The movie theatre gave me credit to a future movie so that I appreciate it Uh if you like the kind of movie that Ben Stiller did a night at the museum then you probably would like something uh like this Uh if you didnt like that type of movie then I really dont think youre gonna like this at all and youre better off saving your money uh and maybe renting it when it comes out on uh video so Anyways I know this is a short review but just wanted to give my honest opinon if uh you liked it you know feel free to share any comments you have but uh theres definitely far better movies that you can uh go see than um tongue clicking than zookeeper so thanks for your time have a great day
