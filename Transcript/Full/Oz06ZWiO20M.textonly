 hey everybody whats going on its time for new episode of Lance TV Im a little late to the game coz Im gonna do a Sucker punch review and I feel like everyone in the world has already seen and reviewed Sucker Punch its like the most reviewed movie of the year so far and lot of the reviews were a lot of fun Ion 9 did a did a big long piece about it that was pretty funny and um Stupid for movies had this really long like really not really long but like really intense rent a about it um and Ill Ill touch Ill touch on a lot of those issues that they raises well but I wanted to give my own two cents I saw last night I knew it was supposed to be really bad but curiosity got the best of me and I I see all those kind of cult movies like this um I just I didnt wanna be left out of the the converstation um it was playing right down the street at the Vista which is my favorite theater here in LA so you know I went to go see it um and it it is just like everybody saying it is bad I dont think its like the worst movie Ive even seen just this year I mean Ive seen a lot of movies this year coz I was doing this week in movies but I would say I I enjoyed Sucker punch like I was more entertained by it than Battle LA which was just a slog and boring and I just try to totally uninteresting and Sucker punch is a failer but like a really ambitious weird the interesting idiosyncratic failure um it is bad but its not bad I think the way most people have been saying its bad its not bad in the way I was expecting it to be bad um it really is not trying to be a dramatic film or an action film like I think most people thats their knock on it is that its not you know conventionally satisfying as like you know with drama that we dont get to know anything about these characters their play isnt interesting their path to freedom is not compelling and its basically telescoped within the first ten minutes of the movie where were sort of told whats gonna happen before it happens um and and all those things are true but I dont think its trying to be that I think its really much more like a musical and I know this is gonna sound silly coz its such a broad goofy mainstream cult kind of movie but it really has more in common with a musical or and opera or even a ballet than a regular narrative film coz like am remains in narrative film is about character development and plot and then spectacle like in third place so its like puts some people in it and youre gonna enjoy spending time with them therere some funny dialogue make them compelling in their relationships compelling and then have a story thats like at five minutes this happens and at ten minutes this happens that like moves forward and has momentum and then you know put in some action or some romance or sex or whatever like to keep people sort of engaged um and thats what traditionl narrative movies do and this movie is really much more like the plot is what little there is and the characters are they are all just place holders its really like like if you went to go see the ballet and its about the spectacles like the story of Swan lake is why people go see Swan lake its the movement and the dancing and the music and the sets and the experience
