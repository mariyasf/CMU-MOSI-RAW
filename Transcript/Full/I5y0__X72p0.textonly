 hey welcome to foxs den today i saw a uh movie called hannah and i saw a couple reviews before i went and i was pretty open to to it being good i at first when i saw the previews i thought it was gonna be stupid to be perfectly honest i thought hannah was gonna suck i was like theres no way that theyre gonna be able to convince me that a sixteen year old girl can take down like six adult dudes so i saw some other reviews and i was like okay i was surprised because these are some people that i trust i i beyond the trailer jeremy jenz these are the people that i get get my my stuff from my reviews so i watched those reviews and they both liked it they s and all the people walking out of the theatre and beyond the trailer really liked it so went and saw it today with some friends and i gotta say i wasnt blown away by it i didnt think it was great or epic or just fantastic it was good i mean i dont regret seeing it it was it was an it was an okay movie basically you have this little girl that uh um eric bana decides to train to be this most paranoid asassin chick in the world because i don i dont wanna give it away because if i say why then youre gonna know anyways skipping past that shes got this like kick A attitude shes gonna you know go in and wipe out this xxx so its it kind of feels like a sundance film festival type of movie its good but its not great its not polished quite as much as i would like it to be it is good though like they convinced me like this chick could probably take that dude down which is pretty hard because i went into the movie thinking theres no way and so they kind of explain it a little bit but not really um i i at the end of the movie the friends i was with uh one of them goes was there a plot to this movie it doesnt have a deep seeded plot theres not like a really good twist its a good action movie its like 90 bourne identity meets 10 willy wonka theres some really strange characters in this movie that i i dont know where they came from it was it did add to the movie though it and it visually its kinda cool how they show her confusion because she grows up in the woods you see that in the trailer shes in the woods like training and stuff so you see it through the video kind of how once she gets into society things are not normal for her they it it kind of spins out of control shes never see a lot of this stuff so it it was and interesting movie it was original and i liked it the soundtrack was interesting um it wasnt bad but it was it was interesting it wasnt the it wasnt the usual i did like kind of like the action the music kinda drove a lot of the action which is cool and so i would say i
