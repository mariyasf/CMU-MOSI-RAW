 the new film Hanna staring Eric Bana Cate Blanchett and it lead star as Hanna Saoirse Ronan who is Academy Award nominee for her film Atonement Now this film is directed by Joe Wright who had directed Atonement and Pride and Prejudice and the big flaw the Soloist This is his most engaging endevour yet Its Joe Wright the action director here and he what he does with Hanna is he makes the movie on like anything weve seen before He takes great actors or acresses in this case like Saoirse Ronan and Cate Blanchett and he puts them in very strange and unusual characters We se Cate Blanchett as an FBI agent with the texas straw and big fake teeth and um Saoirse Ronan as this k kind of Kill Billish action star child um what really need about this movie is the Chamical brothers did the soundtracks whats pulse pounding the entire way through you never know whats gonna happen Theres all these colorful characters Now it isnt a great fantastic tell everybody about that kind of movie I gave it a B but I think its one of those movies thats so unique that you respect that Joe Wright tried to do something completely different here Its colorful its in your face its really non stop from beginning to end and I think um what I took away from this was that really tried very hard to make something original and something that I cant find anything else to compare it to um Hanna is reted PG 13 It is in cinemas everywhere this weekend for my full review on Hanna check out texasartfilmcom Im Dustin Chase
