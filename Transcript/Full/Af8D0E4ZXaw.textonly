 Before I get to the substance of my review Id like to clear up a couple of things First the fact that Im wearing on of my new Marvell geek shirts as Im giving this review is a coincidence and secondly Im going to throw out the spoiler alert I cant express my thoughts and feelings about this movie adequatly without describing some specific things in the third act of the movie which is spoilerific so so if you havent seen the movie and you stick it out through this entire movie video and I end ups saying something that ruins it for you youve been warned Now to the subject of this review Green Lantern starring Ryan Reynolds Blake Lively Peter Sarsgaard Mark Strong among others this was a big event for DC and for Warner Brothers and for superhero fans everywhere Big for Warner Brother because it had a huge production budget and was potentially seen um as the first step of a series of xxx towards justice league movie It was widely believed that a sucess of Green Lantern movie would lead Warner Brothers to adapt the Flash and Wonder woman among possibly others and put them in a justice leage movie with the ritual Batman and Superman So not only that this movie have to deal with the burden of telling its own selfcontained story and setting up its own inevitable sequels it had to deal with the expectations of potentially setting up all that others stuff And how did it do Yeah not good to all the green lantern fans out there I am so sorry I say that for two reasons First because someone owes you an appologie and Warner Brothers is never gonna give you one And secondly because as a Marvell geek I have experienced my fair share of disappointments over the last decade and I can genuinly symphatize with you Before I get to the negatives of the movie let me list off a few of the positives i love Jeffrey Rush and Michael Clarke Duncan as the voice actors They do a great job with their roles They are great additions I also love the casting of Mark Strong as Sinestro Hes perfect for that role and um finally a particular stand out scene for me was the fighter jet sequence It was by far my favorite action seen in the movie I thought it was really well put together and um I thought it worked worked pretty well Um and in fact in spite of all the negatives Im about to mention I thought the movie was working for a while for about the first third um but at the end of act one two significant things happened Hactor Hummand arrives and starts chewing scenery like its a two dollar steak and how Jordan flies off to the green lantern core planet oh and the movie starts sequel baiting These two developments together caused what was up to that point a noble effort to start falling apart at the seams and it was painful to watch I dont even know why I really should begin with listing off the negatives but Im going to start with a few of the superficial things The acting ranges from mediocrity to hamfisted from the live action actors but I cant really blame them for that because a few of them are acting for entire sequences entire lantern for green screens This is Star Wars prequal territory The acting is not that bad but still its that kind of movie making and and you know I wasnt expecting good acting out of
