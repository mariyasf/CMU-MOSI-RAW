Hello you tube civilians Snowman here and today Im going to review Zombieland the new movie starring Jesie Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson the plot follows two survivors of a zombie apocalipse called Columbos played by Jesie Eisenberg and Tallahasse played by Woody Harrlson who have named themselves after the places um to which they have traveled in which I think is a really nice xxx as they do want to avoid becoming emotionally attached to each other Now Columbos is a basically um OCD like hes got loads of rules of how to um survive the zombie apocalipse and hes kind of always been a social outcast and a bit of a loner and when he meets Tallahasse who is like xxx kind of almost battleship crazy zombie killer the um cross of personality is really um charismatic and dynamic and i um odds are really coming later to the film Its not long before they meet two girls one of which is called Wichita um who um Columbos falles for and her smaller sister called I think is Little Rock and basically the um these girls try to get one over of the guys all the time like steal the truck steal the armour all thats still um it just goes to show that you really cant trust anyone in this situation Zombieland is a really sucessful horror comedy as it contains um rea really well done and faithful homages to the zombie horror sub ganre and um while also maintains its kind of detached um satire of the genre but its really well done I have to say that afore the credit sequence which I wont give too much away because um you really wanna see it for yourself um its basically a um slow motion show case of different events this credit sequence I think is the best credit sequence um since Watchman and I honestly think if we hadnt have seen Watchman this would be the best credit sequence of the year yeah it really is good I mean It uses um and this just doesnt apply to the um um credit se sequence on it own but appies to the movie as a whole It really knows how to use s slow motion without making it a gimmick The sequences of the beginning of the film which features Columbus exzplaining some of his rules um to surviving a zombie apocalipse are really well done Well rule number one cardio you know the fat people die first in the apocalipse and stuff like that The xxx sequence is really well done i dont wanna go into his rules because I really dont wanna spoil it for people but its a very kind of um stylistic edge on it it its almost like um imagining Tarantino directed a zombie movie and the style of the film like the um the free streams of slow motion the um the jump cooks and all that stuff feels very kind of um Tarantino ask and I got a real quick out it because I think it realy su
