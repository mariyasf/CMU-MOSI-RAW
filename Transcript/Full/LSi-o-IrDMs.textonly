who to review of the Final destination which I did get a chance to see this weekend on Saturday but I didnt have time to review it I wasnt planning on reviewing it but its actually worth talking about because the movie itself is the same old crap from the series and I actually am not finding the series to be very fun and popcorn kind of movie You just cant walk in exopecting anything other than that um you know you got your kid who cen see in the future he sees that everyone all his friends are gonna die in a horrific accident he averts the accident and saves all his friends so you know karma kicks in and death says no Im gonna come get you and you know you cant escape me and um you know one by one they get picked off in the same order they wouldve died in the original accident and you know the main kid it um its its his job to save everyone essentially convince them that its true in this case it didnt take much convincing which is a little silly but the acting is bad the plot is you know actually the acting is OK I guess for this kind of movie the plot is is is threadbare the the um character development is nil but none of those things matter its a fun movie anyway its a popcorn movie and the main thing I wanna talk about is this dolby 3D um its not real D like the normal 3D thats been around recently the with the plastic black kind of buddy holly glasses this is a different kind of glasses and Ill show a picture right now I took it with my cell phone camera which is a terrible picture but hopefuly it will give you an idea what theyre like theyve actually got a little sensor on the side that wont let you leave the theater its like something youde see on article of clothing in the department store um but um this 3D definatelly looks a lot better I think that real D it corrects some of the issues that that had like I I found the real D the image was still sort of misaligned even with the glasses on um and um this this corrects that problem completetly at least where I was sitting I was sitting right in the middle of the theater I had ideal seats because its good to sit right in the middle of the theater with 3D and um at least in my experience it is um but the they looked awesome the 3D itself really had improved it looks like things are actually coming out at you um the color looked great coz sometimes 3D can mess up the color at least the old anaglyphic 3D I think real D it you know had sort of had sort of tempted but it winds itself its also um not ideal for for the imigae itslef um but this looked amazing looked really good and it makes it worth going to see this movie if youve got um the dolby 3D somewhere in your town weve got at the Studio movie grill theater chain in North Texas theyve theyve bought the system and theyve invested millions of dollars into these glasses um so they obviously expected to make a lot of money and I hope this takes over as the new system I would love that that be that would be cool to see I mean eventually were gonna get burned out as a soci as a society once agian were gonna be burned out on 3D because its it is a gimmick ultmatelly um but I will say um with this with this quality of 3D you could almost make you know a regular like a dramatic movie or an action movie or something that was really good movie and you could make it 3D and it wouldnt at all
