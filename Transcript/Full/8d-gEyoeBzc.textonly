reaveal one it now um Im gonna give the reasons why I like him but mostly Im gonna give the reasons of why I dont think hes gonna be a classic in the same way as the first movie Predator or Aliens um which I think Rodrigez was going for he th th he always said that he was gonna do the sequel um he wanted this to be um th the Predator equivalent of aliens um as um you know as aliens was to alien um and Im gonna really point out why that I dont think he really pulled he pulled that off um why was a mistake really to try and do that um but I did enjoy it so um Im gonna point out the stuff I did like there were some action scenes in it um the characters were well developed um not all of the characters but um I would say that um there was theres good there were four good characters in there um I I liked agent Brodys character I thought he was um well developed you know well drawn out character someone you cared about I liked the girl who was the Israeli sniper I thought she was the number one well drawn character um I liked the Russian guy Juri I think his name was um you cared you there was enough in there for you to care about him and xxx was an interesting character um he had some funny he had a few one lines that was quite quite funny yeah once unfortunately um I think in the writing somewhere they they just werent um developed enough fear to care about them um and that includes is it Topher Graces I think I think his name was includs his character um I just didnt think it was well developed enough and um I also I I include in that Laurence Fishburnes character as well who I think Rodrigez when he wrote the mo wrote the movie was going for a Marlon Brando apocalipse now type of character but he actually found um when hes seen come up it slowed the movie down um and this is the problem um with Predator to Predators compared to Predator Predator is really well paced movie and it picks up speed and never lets go ev even in the same xxx where they they slow you know they meant to have some dialogue and and talk about whats going on yo you know it felt the movie slowed down wheres it in the middle of this when when they they with um Laurence Fishburne character it does slow down a great deal I didnt really feel um the inclusion of his charater was necessary um it couldve been written out I know he was there to um give out the main characters some information on who these new Pre Predators are and what theyre about but um
