 Hey guys its Bree and today Im gonna talk to you about The Expendables So last night I decided to watch the Expendables at midnight and I was unbelievably shocked how much I loved it It was full of action great dialogue the characters were so great and well developed Its really just a heart warming story Its a great movie to see over and over again your whole family can see it Its not that violent xxx it is a teenytiny bit violent and not enough so you can bring your 5 year old I really realy felt for the dad in the Expendables because he was protecting over his family and after they went missing even though theyre a bend of outsiders and thay have all those powers the dad was just really protective and he made sure that hes whole family was safe Very heart warming very touching Brad Bird is a great writer and director He wrote and directed Ratatouille and the Iron Giant um I think that my favorite part of the entire movie was when you find out at the end that the little baby had powers It was so cute just the great great movie I really recommend you all see the Expendables My boyfriend got really excited when I told him we were gonna go see the Expandables and than um when I went to blockbuster and I picked it up and I brought it back home he got really disappointed I think its because it was such a moving film and I dont think he knows how to handle his emotions in that department so it was just a little awkward but um weve overcome that You know a lot of people have been talking about the Expendables even though it came out such a long time agao theres been a lot of buzz about it lately and everyones you know a lot of controversy over it Everyones been saying its really intense I can see that There are parts that are very intense but for the most part it is a family friendly warm and fuzzy movievoovie So go see the Expendables I know you guys are gonna love it Stay tuned guys I have many more movies to go in through
