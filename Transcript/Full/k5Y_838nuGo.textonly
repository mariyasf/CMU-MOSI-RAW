I havent posted a video because Ive been busy with school I have like four weeks left and it has been crazy trying to get final projects done and situated but um and mid terms so anyway Im back to do a review for you guys I have not seen Robin Hood yet so Im not reviewing that and I was gonna see McGruber this weekend and I still might so there might be review some time later from McGruber review but Im here to review Shrek forever after which I was not excited to see and it actually surprised me um to summarize it Shrek forever after is not Shrek hes in life and basically his life is repetitive same thing every day and than he realizes he just has a freak out momemnt he realizes that this isnt he wants to be a regular ogre again blah blah blah kind of goes on he meets Rumpelstiltskin and he signs a contract for being one day as an ogre and he has to give up one day in his past you know like one day of his life he couldnt remember well Rumpelstiltskin is tricky and what happens is that Shrek is transported to xxx ogre but then he cho Rumpelstiltskin chose the day Shrek was born so that Shrek never said Fiona he could be entrapped in castle of Rumpelstiltskin basically thats it and I have to admit I I like Shrek I do I like the first two Shreks quite a bit um theyve become quite a bit overrated but the first two were pretty excellent the third one was a piece of crap and thats why I was not excited about the fourth one um which actually was really good I did like the fourth one quite a bit um I I did enjoy it it reminded me of the first one had the same kind of vibe like the first one and it just was better maybe its the baby ogres maybe bringing in the baby ogres really brought it down coz the first two were great and they brought in the kids and it made it more kiddy friendly movie the first two were kid movies but they were had adult humour I though that adults would appreciate and would go over the kids heads and this is what the fourth one kind of has the third one was more kid humour though it didnt have that much adult humour in it um yeah the fourth one it does have kid humour definatelly its a kids movie but it does have some adult humour those are quote in this movie that sounded so dirty coming out but it as great did anyone notice yes um something about waffle hole am I the only one am I perverted not to think that that sounds dirty coz it totally does waffle hole it had me laughing out loud and I dont think that many other people were laughing about it but I was um creepy seventeen year old in the audience with her cousins who are five and four and yeah hah thats what happened um yeah its its better than the third one absolutely I didnt see it in 3D because my one of my cousins doesnt like the glasses
