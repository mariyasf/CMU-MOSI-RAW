and Im gonna give you a review of JI Joe Rise of the Cobra hissing anyway I actually missed this movie when it came out in xxx because I really wanted to see it actually but I never was able to kind of connect and actually see it some things felt through never was able to see it just saw it on DVD rented it and um first of all I I actually was never a huge fan of the JI Joe TV series or big collector of the action figures um I watched a TV show every once in a while but I wasnt big on it um that being said I still got a lot of references that theyve made in the movie they even may a reference that said noone is half the battle and just in case you didnt read the above thing on my title this review is gonna have some spoilers in it so if you havent seen the movie and you dont want me to spoil it you can watch my other video right now go click on that and watch that and um you know enjoy yourself with that video going back to JI Joe Rise of the Cobra um this movie is incredible cheezy but in the good way I in ist theres two types of cheezy and this is the good kind of cheezy yes it the acting is a little rough in some parts well you know um corny but the m the script is corny I mean the way its written is corny I mean I didnt go to this movie expecting to see the dark night and quite honestly I wish Ive seen this over the summer because if Ive seen it over the summer I probably wouldve rated it best action movie I saw this summer this summer was kind of weird with the action movies if you ask me I did like Transformers 2 even though a lot of people didnt like that but you know this movie um this really um wouldve made up for a disappointment that it had a terminator salvation um um this movie stars Channing Tatum um Marlon Wayans um Sienna Miller Christopher Eccleston Dennis Quaid and Rachel Nichols and um you know you have a lot of good actors in this movie actually a lot of good actors in you know theyre in there this is a cheezy um movie so you know its not like you actually getting like Academy Award quality acting performances um and now the performances are like something like to write home about um that being said you can tell that lot people were having fun with this and theres a difference between when an actor is dulling in a performance and when actor is having fun with the performance and I xxx like in particular Joseph Joseph GordonLevitt had a lot of fun with his role I think um Rachel Nichols had a lot of fun with her role Marlon Wayans had a lot of fun um I cannot pronounce his name but the guy from Lost had a lot of fun Dennis Quaid I think had a lot of fun um same with Christopher Eccleston so I I think it was cool to actually see Ray Park in action great action star he does a great job with his snake eyes which is always cool to see that um one thing I also like to add about this JI Joe movie is how international it was it was very divert
