 Hey this is Cheeseburger Im out here with Hard Body Review Today I am reviewing Rango Now Rango was just fantastic Surprised me uh it was so much better than I thought it was going to be Uh this movie stars Johnny Depp voiced as the main character which was a chameleon named Rango and he was just a normal household pet Got into a freak accident wound up in a desert stumbled across this town and this town was like from a good old Western It had all this stereotypical traits of a Western town Um with the like the townspeople and wha like the they were they didnt ride on horses They they rode on like some weird birds and stuff like that I dunno but it was it was cool It was a great movie Um And throughout the movie Johnny Depp kinda became like the unsung hero and During the movie he was trying to find his himse his true self like who he really is Um just trying to help these people in the town And Now what I loved about this movie was like the supporting characters in this movie Um all the oh God The all the animals were just so funny Um they all played off each other Theyre like the dumb kinda cowboys that dont know what theyre doing always asking dumb questions staying saying stupid shit and it was just oh it was hysterical There was this one character he was like a bird and he had an arrow going through one eye and out the back of his head laughing and the stuff he said was just it was just so funny Um Now Gor Vivinsky who directed this movie hes known for all the Pirates of the Caribbean movies um he brought his live action directing to his first knocking animated feature and he did a wonderful job All the cinematography in this movie was great Like all the sunsets and all the landscapes of the films they just looked so realistic in every almost every scene Um Like this movie had great action sequences This aw this one really cool action sequences where like this Ronny uh Johnny Depps posse they were getting chased by all these like possums or nah I wouldnt say possums but prairie dogs I dont know Some kind of animal Im not even sure what they were But they were just chasing them and all these like bats and aw it was just so cool Like a covered wagon horse kinda cowboy chase sequence Oh it was so cool Um But this movie it had everything Humor romance action of course um it was just It was fun it was a fun entertaining movie Uh it was good for the entire family Um definitely recommend checking seeing this uh checking this movie out Uh I rated it four out of five stars Um The one thing I didnt like about this movie was they brought the main chara uh the bad character I should say in kinda late But that didnt really matter Um everything else held up its own Um definitely check out this movie Rango Uh in a theatre near you
