 hello youre watching watch this fucking movie my name is jen and i will be reviewing blue valentine for you today so i saw blue valentine in theatres a while back and i really really loved it and i thought that the performances in it were incredible and i was just thinking about um how its the performances in it were sort of over overlooked at the academy awards because um there were so many great movies that came out this year i mean um the kings speech black swan 127 hours inception and uh if im missing any im sorry um theyre just off the top of my head but there were a lot of great movies out this year some of the great performances um of last year were kind of overlooked cuz there were just so many of them and i think that blue valentine has um become kind of underrated so blue valentine is about a married couple on the verge of uh you know a collapse they are they used to be in love they were in love and they have a child together but um as you see from the beginning of the movie everything just seems to be falling apart like they dont seem to be connecting anymore um theres no communication between the two of them so the husband played by ryan gosling um decides to take his wife whos pl played by michelle williams uh they go up to some kind of sleazy hotel to as like a last ditch attempt to finally connect again as they used to when they were younger and as this movie uh progresses you co you sort of see these flashbacks of uh when they were first met and the kind of love that uh that was between them at the at the initial stages of their relationship and its truly heartbreaking to see that contrasted with the state of things uh in the present when you see them you know they they almost hate each other and you see the husband trying to reach out to his wife but the wife um it seems like she cant even stand him she cant really stand being around him and she um doesnt respect him and smacking lips all sorts of things and theres a lots of smacking lips theres so many dynamics going on with this relationship and i think that it was it was a great story so uh blue valentine what did i think of it it was after i got out of the theatre I sort of thought to myself wow ive seen so many movies about broken relationships about couples that are on the verge of divorce and its sort of like a contrived plot thats been used over and over again because its um its an audience pleaser you know an especially when it comes to romantic dramas like thumping its uh it gets the audiences to theatres because its a compelling idea but its been uh done
