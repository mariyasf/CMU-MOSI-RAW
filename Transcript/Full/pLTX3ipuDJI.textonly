 what can I say about the Predators movie I guess thats exactly you would expect from the movie in this genre a group of people the bad guys discover as to what the bad guys are and in the big long thing is who lives and who dies nothing new is brought in those Predator series no surprises no big twist no finish I like to tease some mystery and great plot what couldve been but than all is explained and disppeares ten minutes later its just a clear remake of Predator from back in 1997 with the premise being almost identical althought what wasnt the same was the connection to each other which first movie had and this one not in the first run they were a team and they worked together and you see the personalites this movie just pops a group of different killers down together and lets them interact poorly you dont see any of the personalities when one dies you dont mourn over tham an you dont get an attachment to anybody of the acting nothing stands out a spectacular which is to be expected of the movie like this but nothing sucks either which gains the movie some points I guess the film is xxx cast though with the Im trying to be bad ass Brody as a selfelected leader a doctor played by Topher Grace and a short camio in the way of Laurence Fishburne what disappointed me was that one of the most hyped actors in the movie was only in there for short amount of time and I know you cant hype a movie with an unknown actors so even if someone is in there for a few minutes you should hype them but its just a little weak overall for me than we were looking forward to him and he was gone quickly although what it did do was interesting but i but it didnt make sense he co Laurence Fishburne comes in and tells the characters things that only screen writers shouldve known about which gives a little more of f fony feel this whole thing just like one of the girls tells the exact story of the first movie its a pointless scene for the audience and the characters it dosent give an give any insight or help its just make them seem like she sa she saw the first movie in finale I would only recommend this movie for a rental non in theater because its a low grade sequal to the 87th version and only if you like the series
