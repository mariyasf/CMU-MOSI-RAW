 hi folks um id like to quickly talk about machete im sorry and disappointed to say this i didnt like it i couldnt get into it i i actually knew what i was getting myself into i know it its not meant to be taken seriously maybe 70s exploitation movies are more cheesy than machete and maybe planet terror im im not sure im just guessing sound of cars the action and humor were mostly flat i i cant explain why the humor was was mostly flat because a few or several jokes actually felt they they they actually felt felt funny but but i just did didnt laugh sigh it probably would have helped if i went with with someone if at least one other one other person went with me sound of cars what whatever im just guessing again smacking lips maybe only 5 jokes made me laugh its its clear to me that steven segals death was supposed to be darkly funny and uh although like i like dark humor but i just couldnt find it funny i mean uh was it silly in a good way no i i i guess so i mean its its it wasnt annoying it it it was just there i i i i wasnt i wasnt amused i i knew obviously the movie would be gory maybe a lot more than the expendables but i feel that the movie wasnt really concerned with being exciting the action feels that its um it its its pretty much just uh quick cut or slash blood scream you know lip smacking fffflat shit lip smacking still the the church shootout however brief that was it it was alright maybe it could have been 20 seconds longer the the the final shootout
