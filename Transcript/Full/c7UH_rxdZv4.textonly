 Hey guys so I just went and saw the Green Hornet oh my gosh bad movie really bad movie I wish I werent because I truly love an action flick action comedy flick even better right oh no So um Im gonna keep this one short but basically Seth Rogan brought none of the charm that he normally does to his roles In fact I have to say that this was one of those obnoxious main characters Ive seen a long time yeap a horrible protagonist He um had all the charm of a narcissist xxx boy the whole film and unlike other films for they kind of a narcisstic xxx boy but they bring something to the table you know theres something that just kind of makes tham so sl slightly endearing even though theyre kind of the jack ass you know youre like oh theyre still kind of cool no no hes unfunny not funny at all um hes just a jack ass um Kato kicks ass handsome guy boring hes boring just like look away what he can do he can do lots of stuff Sath Rogan goes like oh man that is so cool I cant believe you can do this stuff wow wow good thing youre my sidekick what wa what hes what w why you have no skills whatsoever you cant even tell funny jokes and than Cameron Diaz whos supposed to be plucky I guess but shes just kinf of useless Hi Im pretty I have a giant smile Im supposed to know thingsum walk of screen um yeah the characters didnt care weather they lived or died Kato was the only one that was any good whatsoever and he was still boring um yeah the special effects were OK nothing thats worth going to theaters to see and yeah I think the only character who actually showed their motivation bihind anything they did was the villain He was the only character that was slightly interesting who seemed to have genuine affection for other human beings and it was kind of interesting I mean the only character that shows genuine care for other people be the villain hmm yeah skip it dont see it I gue
