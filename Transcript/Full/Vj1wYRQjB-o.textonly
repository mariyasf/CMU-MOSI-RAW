 hello again Frank one two castle I know its been a quite long time since Ive done one of these but um I was very busy and you all probably saw movies over Christmas that you wanted to see anyway so Im back Anyway I went to go see Green Hornet which of course stars Seth Rogan who also helped write the movie um it was directed by Michel Gondry it stars other actors such as Jay Chou Christopher Christoph Waltz and Cameron Diaz um the Green hornet is a it was just like a radio a radio show like a let alone ranger and the green hornet was essentially like batman he was um a normal guy who used um gadgets and his side kick to stop to felt fight crime usually the natzis but thats not what this movies about um huh the way the green hornet was done via Seth Rogans point of view it was parody um the green hornet which is um his real name is Britt Reid he dosnt know how to do much um when he fights his xxx he has now science behind it in fact most of the work is done by Kato Kato fights for the green hornet um he makes the black beauty which is the car that green hornet uses he makes gadgets for the green hornet and he dosent get that much recognition but he helps out because he wants to fight for good um the movie starts off as as any superhero movie would you have character you have the main character who has a crisis happen in his life and he becomes a hero thats what this movie is um I thought the character is well done I loved how Seth Rogan played the green hornet I loved how Jay Chou played Kato they did a very good job Christoph Waltz he plays the bad guy he was the bad guy in Inglorious bastards um he just keeps doing that you know the bad guy where hes he seems calm but deep down hes an insane psychopath well he plays that well so hes a good villain he also has some really cool guns so that its like a desert eagle but it has to barrels to it its pretty pretty scary looking I wouldnt want that pointed at me um then Cameron Diaz plays the love interest um shes a very very very bright um bright journalist and um Britt Reid hires her on her good looks but he finds out theres actually a lot more of her than he initially thought and hes always trying to like um try to scare to fall in love with him but of course shes she doesnt wanna anything to do with him and I who would I mean Seth Rogan but anyw anyway I digress um like I said I thought the movie was great the action they do have is really well done um they did a good job with car they did a good job with the fight scenes they did like xxx almost fight scenes where they slow down they go through everything um
