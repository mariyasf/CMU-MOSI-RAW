HiIm OliviaUm this is my New Moon review So first of all Im not a xxxI have read the books um and I thought they were average Lets face it they are really not master pieces I thought Twilight directed by Catherine Hardwicke was actually really rather enjoyable um I mean obviously it had its flaws but cinematicly I thought it was good quite good It wasit was enjoyable I wasnt thinking on hearing that Chris Weitz was gonna start the New Moon because of the destruction that was Phillip Pullman the Golden Compass I thought that film was awful and I I didint really know what to expect from New Moon um in terms of his direction Overall New Moon was it was OK just average the thing is its a very good translation of the book Its very very loyal to the book and I really appreciate that loyalty um however it is this loyalty to the original source that gives it its flaws Because people have read the book to understand what was going on And the book is not necessarily the most thrilling book ever I mean the entire xxx is Bella Swan Kristen Kristens Stewards character mobbing around completely depressed It wasnt really the best the most thrilling read ever Ill say that So overallNew Moon even with the bigger better budgets huh it was still too long the angsty too angsty moments withdrawn out to the max as far as thay can go and the script it left all the key plots and emotion from the characters to be exposed through dialogue I think it was Empire magazines review of New Moon that said that Kristen relied heavily on the tactic of tactic of blinking a lot which she really does do a lot but at the same goes for Rob Pattinson as Edward and Taylor Lautner as Jacob they do a lot of frowning Im a manly man and I frown For the moment in this the whole cinema was laughting and you knew you shouldnt be laughing My favorite scene would definately be the Volturi um then my wins on screen wiskers I mean they were really worn in a lots which is a shame because I thought xxx really rather good and um Michael Sheen as Aro as well he was rather enjoyable to watch And I think the Volturi that was my exciting bit of the entire film The rest of the film was just watching Kristen just mob around and that was really boring See I said it was a really rushed review I mean Im really busy at the moment um so I hope they have got more videos coming up seeing but yes
