This is the one minute review of Suckerpunch Poop music in background laughing currently in theatres starring no one youve ever heard of directed by zach snyder who also directed watchmen 300 the legends of gahul guardians of owl land whatever that came out and i never saw it breathing in deeply so heres the thing with this movie i actually saw this movie a couple weeks back ive been kind of on a one minute review hiatus sorry and so i never really see other reviews before i do mine but i have seen some reviews of suckerpunch and this suckers getting this sucker is getting panned like last airbender garbage panned and i wanna say this i did not think it was like last airbender garbage um heres why yes stuttering t theres problems with this and i wanna talk about them but you know it looks beautiful there are some really cool uh moments in this it actually has some some them thematically it has some cool themes about heroism and about like taking ownership of yourself and things like that which i resonated with and i whi and which i appreciated but heres the essential problem with this movie the essentail problem of this movie well maybe this would be the best way to put it um there was a uh a comedian named dave chapelle um and dave chapelle um and another comedian chris rock are um african american and in their comedy they sometimes take on african american culture what they perceive to be african american culture and so they will essentially make fun of black people and the thing with dave chapelle and with chris rock is because theyre black they can kinda do that and theres something about that thats acceptable um if like me or laughing some other white person or hispanic person or whatever did the same jokes it would not be funny it would be completely inappropriate in fact it would be racist so zach snyder here is making a movie thats ostensibly about female empow empowerment but its a movie about female empowerment which includes a lot of clearing throat slapping that includes a lot of women in bustiers that includes a lot of violence done against women and ultimately in which most of the women end up completely disempowered clapping laughing so okay if zach snyder were a woman i would say okay shes making a comment about the way women cant be empowered in male dominated societies in the way men um distract and and hurt and damage women and prevent them from asserting who they really are i could kinda see that in a sort of chris rock dave chapelle way but zach snyder is a guy and because of that this stuff kinda ends up looking like the sh he man woman haters club so if i give zach snyder the benefit of the doubt this is a movie that looks great has some bad acting and has way too much violence against women if i dont give zach snyder the benefit of the doubt
