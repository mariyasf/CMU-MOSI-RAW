Silvester Stalone produced by Silvester Stalone starring Silvester Stalone directed by Silvester Stalone so yeah Silvester Stalone so its gonna be an action movie obviously and you you guys all know what the Expendables are and if you dont basically slice of the memo to all the action stars for the last twenty years and say hay show up for this movie so most of them dead and its really what you wouldve expact its not a compelling narrative by any means theres little to no character development all movie and yet this movie is incredibly enjoyable for action fans um start off kind of like who the charcters are um Silvester Stalone obviously is the lead character and he leads this troop of mercenaries called the Expendables and really theres no humongous tale to these guys just a bunch of army mercs who now make a living taking jobs um this movie just falls among other jobs just like you know the kind of the biggest hadrest job he had yet and essentially they are to take down a tyrant owned in another nation and thats really itjust take down this tyrant not a complicated story but you know what you dont need a complecated formula for an action movie theres a bad guy guy go take him down thats really all you need this movie essentially was made for three reasons in my opinion the first reason is the obvious just to make an exciting enjoyable action film and thats you know all thats all you really needed to do and definatelly comes through on that Ill touch on why in a bit the second reason this movie was made and in my opinion the real reason it was made again its Silvestre Stalone telling himself I still got it um Ive got to give him credit Hes in terrific shape for a man twice my age who looks significantly better than me thats kind of made me feel depressed but hey whatever and is showing yeah maybe hes not what he was twenty twenty five years ago but he still has every right to be billed as an action star theres actually yeah yeah scenes triple stand off with Silvestre Arnold Swarzeneger Bruce Willis and yeah actually in a way kind of fell hollow because you know its basically it was Stalone knowing these guys arent in the shape they were twenty twenty five years ago so hes like hey look I still got it yeah and I dont know if this scene took place fefteen twenty years ago when those guys were absolutely prime it wouldve been just um absolutely breath taking monumental moment in cinematic history but seeing it today now when it was really nothing more than just a one xxx ship it lost a lot of feeling it wasnt the final you know finally happened u uniting that we all come to expect it just it felt kind of cut and dry which would start the planning that I wish it has happened earlier in their careers the third and in my opinion most important reason this movie happened is in a way it felt like it was passing on the tou
