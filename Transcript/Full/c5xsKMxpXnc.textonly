Im here to review Adjustment Bureau and I thought this movie was gonna be really good because matt damon was in it and I was really disappointed so this movies about david norris played by matt damon and what happens is that he is going to run for new york senator and he just cant win because he keeps on making mistakes a lot of mistakes involve stuff that just makes him look bad in the public eye pictures and stuff that he did where the people were like we cant have this guy cause hes not mature enough so now hes preparing his losing speech and he sees a girl in the bathroom and they instantly kiss I dont know they have like they talk for like five minutes and instantly kiss which is dumb but uh she runs away because these cops are chasing her because she crashed a wedding so the next day the adjustment bureau comes in these people that are supposed to change things so that people can have their own fate and the world will be alright now what happens is that matt damon is supposed to spill coffee on himself at exactly 705 but the Adjustment Bureau guy falls asleep and chuckling yeah he forgets to make him spill coffee on himself so he catches the bus and guess who he sees emily blunt so the adjustment bureau is pissed off because the guy that was supposed to make him spill the coffee and make him miss the bus messed up and now he actually knows her and gets her number and everything and theyre not supposed to meet theyre not supposed to fall in love its not part of the plan so matt damon goes to work you know sees his office and everything and sees everybody doesnt even realize that theyre not moving but yea when he opens the door to his boss office he sees that these people are like adjusting his life and hes wondering what the hell is going on and you know they tell him they adjust peoples lives and that they might have to erase his mind completely unless he stays away from the girl and doesnt tell anybody about the plan so matt damon of course does not listen and he still wants to be with the girl so he goes against the adjustment bureau but they keep on changing things on him so it makes it hard for him to be with her so pretty the whole story is about fate des versus free will and which one is more important what i liked about this movie was the concept was cool theres this people t you cant do anything because they are controlling your life pretty much like who you love and all this but they did not execute it very well and they left a lot of plot holes this movie is terrible for these reasons and im gonna tell you why number one because the love is forced you dont feel that these two people love each other and it is very rushed i mean you dont see why these two people love each other theres no character development really with these two like they have their own separate character development but none where these two should be together theres no reason why they should be together you dont see why they should like each other cause they dont show it in the movie i mean the the way they show it is like they ta
