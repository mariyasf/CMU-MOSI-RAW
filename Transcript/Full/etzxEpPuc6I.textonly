so here we have another hasbro d production coming out of the movie business first we had transformers now we got GI Joe so we got GI the rise of the cobra starring Channing tatum and marlon wayans and dennis quaid um the movie starts off marlon and channing are playing rip cord and doom theyre both two dudes in the military and theyre transporting this uh like this nanotech technology if youve seen the trailer you know when they shoot the big bazooka at the eiffel tower and it falls and it makes all that crumble pretty much little robots in that thats making things break apart um so channing tatum and marlon are transporting it they get ambushed by um i think its cobra its kinda hard to explain it cuz its like the dude that made the technologies i i cant ruin the movie so Im not gonna tell you what the plot is but they get ambushed by some dudes with some ill technology and then the joes come and save them from the bad guys that want to steal the the war warheads so they go down and they meet dennis quaid the leader of the gi joe program and they get recruited into the joe program um from there it just goes into ridiculousness the thing about this movie is like i i i wanna compare it to transformers 2 and i actually did i was like you know theyre both hasbro toys theyre both moves that are com made for children but they have a lot of adult situations in it but the thing about gi joe compared to transformers is transfomers 2 didnt know what it wanted to do like in some parts you had people getting killed and the next part you had fart jokes and stupid frat humor and all that other crap as for gi joe was it was just like laughing its the the plot the the acting is terrible the plot is ridiculous but no one took it seriously like like even the actors were just like you know its a movie about a fucking toy so were just gonna just do whatever we gonna do laughing so theyre just sitting there like this one part where the girls like my daddy taught me to WIN WIN and then shes looking in the camera and im like wow like um this actings pretty bad but the they they knew it was just a movie about a a a a doll so they didnt take it seriously like i didnt i didnt grow up watching gi joe i didnt have any of the action figures im sorry i said dolls earlier please dont kill me but i didnt have any of the gi joe action figures i didnt watch the cartoons i know some of the little catch phrases like knowing is half the battle and all that joint which they throw in here like every two seconds but the movie was well it was ridiculously terrible like it was like the acting was terrible the action made up for it there was parts this ive seen some creative depths in this movie ive never seen before ive seen people get shot in the eye you know and that would be it but people getting shot in the eye and then the they heads explode and then some dude get his torso cut open and and some dudes hanging out of the car his head got blown off and freaking people are flying and jumping i mean i was i cant say i saw this movie and i wasnt
