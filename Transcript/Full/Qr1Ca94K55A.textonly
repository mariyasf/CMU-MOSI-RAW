 hi this is cheeseburger man from xxxby the review and this is my straightforward review of Drive Angry 3D now this movie is just ridiculous and I I thought it was excellent um stars Nicolas Cage as a man who escapes from hell because he wants to rescue his granddaughter coz she was kidnapped by satanic worshipers and they wanna sacrifize her so they can bring hell on earth now Nicolas Cage runs into Amber Heard character she was a waitress and she kind of becomes an unofficial sidekick of Nicolas Cage in this movie now she was really xxx in it I felt because they needed something hot to look at on the screen for an hour and forty minutes her acting was pretty bad she didnt really do anything for me but the real star that fell out of this movie was William Fichtner character or William Fichtner I should say his character was the accountant of hell and his job was to bring Nicolas Cage back to the other world now Nicolas Cage isnt really known for his acting lately coz hes had a lot of bad movies and his acting wasnt really good in that movie but it made it hysterical and it was just funny with all of these little one liners that he had and whatever so no Im not saying this movie is bad coz its its not its everything I expected it to be Like I said before it had tacky one liners that were just hysterical there was just plenty of blood um there was there was plenty of sex there was plenty drugs and rocknroll whatever you want it it was it was good um one of the big things I was disappointed though was I felt that they couldve done a lot more with 3D I thought I was expecting to see more body parts flying around after they were shot up by shotguns but I mean it just it just didnt happen um there were a lot of gun fights and some really cool gun fights but there were just people getting shad with blood and splatter and I thought it was just gonna be more than that but so I was a little disappointed in that um now I dont really recommend this if you go on a date with some girl um but if youre xxx movie goer like I am I totally recommend seeing this because its just a fun entertaining movie and I think that you will enjoye it
