 so Kate Hudson has a new movie its called Something borrowed Its one of those romantic comedies that we all dread Now the real star of Something borrowed is Ginnifer Goodwin who you might remember from Walk the line also in this movie is John Krasinski and newcomer Colin Egglesfield I think its how you pronounce his name now Kate Hudson plays herself in this movie Annoyingly she kind of yells and screams through the whole movie and if you can tolerate her the rest of the movie isnt any batter um it kind of follows the path of My best friends wedding 1997 Julia Roberts movie except it takes thirty minutes longer to deviate from the scripts of My best friends wedding there are some funny moments but mostly its just Kate Hudson being very annoying and I think its predictable up an to a point I think with with these kind of movies we kind of predict and we second guess ourselves so I will give it points for not being exactly like My best friends wedding even at the trailer sets it up that way Ginnifer Goodwin is fun to watch but I dont think shes leading material and like I said Kate Hudson couldnt be more annoying here If there is any silverlining in this movie its John Krasinski who I dont usually like but he has some of the funniest scenes in this movie He seems to be the only realistic character here Something borrowed opens in May its gonna be playing nationwide its rated PG 13 for texas art and film Im Dustin Chase and for the full review of Something Borrowed check out texasartfilmcom
