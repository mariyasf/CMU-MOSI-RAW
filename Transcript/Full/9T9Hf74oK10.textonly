hi youre watching Watch this fucking movie My name is Jenn and I will be reviewing Never let me go for you today so today is the day of the Oscars and I was just thinking about all the nominees and um particularly the movies that I feel like shouldve gotten nominated but didnt and Never let me go is actually one of those movies I saw Never let me go a while back actually so its not completely fresh in my mind but I do remember a lot of it and I do remember um what I thought about it I think a lot of people are really split about this movie theres a certain deadpan nature to it it was a pretty slow movie for the most part and it was it was thoughful but there are you know therere critics of movies that are sometimes too thoughful in a way and I think that would never let me go a lot of critics said that it relied too much on the audience to um explore the themes in the film and you know tightly so I guess which um in a way a lot of the themes in Never Let me go which were very profound and deep they werent fully explored and I think that the movie did rely on you to kind of figure it out and kind of deal with those ideas by yourself but regardless I thought it was a very good movie the story surrounds threee main characters two boys and one I mean two girls and one boy sorry but two girls are played by Carey Mulligan and Keira and Keira Knightley and the boy is played by Andrew Garfield those three are some of the best young actors of today Carey Mulligan I mean shes been in an Education she and everything she does she has so much grace to it and so much fluidity and Keira Knightley I mean everybody knows her from the Pirates of the Carribean but I mean in her other works like Pride and Prejudice shes just been realy fantastic and Andrew Garfield of course everybody knows him form the Social Network and hes also going to be the new Spiderman so look out for that that should be interesting but anyways they did um they did act very well and again the story surrounds these three kids and theyre growing up in the boarding school and you dont exactly know what is going on I think it takes place sometime um its I dont think its present day but its um its someone modern I would say its not its not like a period piece or anything but um these three kids and you see them as children they are growing up in a boarding school and you dont exactly know whats going on theres something off about the boarding school theyre the children are told that their health is supposed to be paramount and that above all things that they should be healthy and that sort of becomes the theme throughout their whole childhood it is just taking care of themselves and preparing themselves to go out into that outside world and I think early on the twist is revealed Never let me go is actually based on a novel and if youve read the novel and I
