 Lets talk Legend of the guardians Im gonna give this a grade B minus the CGI work the 3D is spectacular the flying sequences are beautiful and the owls are really wonderful and come of real and they do have very nice personalites and you have a rate for them but the story is very dark in fact my six years old was scared most of the movie basic just is its just good owls versus bad owls the bad owls kidnap two little good owls and one of them escapes and runs off to the guardians and than the guardians fight bad owls and they win and save owldom they all get to live happily ever after um my other complaint other than that theres like nothing light or funny in this story to break up the slumber mood is the battle itself You cant tell which are the good owls which are the bed owls they really needed to somehow set them apart with armor or I mean some of them wear armor but some on both sides wear armor anyway this is one you can skip or you can see up to you and thats it now off to go help with my six um bye
