I mean it starts out really slow and you get a kind of back story about the the whole green lantern thing and what theyre all about and how it was all created then it takes you to Earth where Ryan Reynolds character Hal Jordan is a hot headed pilot who gets into a lot of trouble in one xxx um turns out hes chosen to represent the green lanterns um from Earth so not to spoil anything but um he goes he trains and um turns out hes got to fight off this evil um thing called the Parallax which um feeds off a fear and the green lantern represents will power so its about little will power versus fear and its just coming to Earth and its gonna destroy everything so hes got to try to find the way to stop it essentially before it destroys everything because its just feeding off a fear then theres this theres also subplot villain um Hector Hammond who because exposed th by the fear and starts mutating and turning into a villain and I wont tell you what happens with that or what the ending result is or anything like that but overall um go see it it was a cool movie the acting was allright um I thought they casted kind of well but what really threw me off was the dialogue very cheezy dialogue oh my god the whole movie had a really dry dialogue there were a couple funny parts but I dont think the humour redeemed the movie from being so bad in the dialogue department whoever wrote this isnt the writer definatelly but overall I enjoyed it the the whole movie I was you know thinking this isn as bad as Ive heard and it wasnt um and the movie was pretty short as like an hour and a half and the dialogue threw me off other than that um I think it was and OK movie definatelly a little bit above average I dont think its as bad as you probably read on reviews so yeah go see it tell me what you think adios
