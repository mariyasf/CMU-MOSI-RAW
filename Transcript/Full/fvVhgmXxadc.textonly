 Hi Im Michael and Im Michael the movie man Today were reviewing Sucker punch this is the new film by Zack Snyder the director of Three hundred and the Watchman and this is Snyders first film thats not based on preexisting work Now getting to set up of Sucker punch which Ill get to in a minute it only had the potential to be a film that was both provking and action packed but unfortunately its just an ugly wild violent unvolving and sadistic exercise that I got very little joy out of in fact I got mostly pain out of it the story invoves young girl played by Emily Browning and after her mother dies she and her sister are sent to live with their evil stepfather after going through tons of abuse thats pretty heavily inferred in the opening sequence the young girl besides to try to escape but she ends up killing her sister by accident and than shes insitutionalized with her stepfather and is set up to have a lobotomy thankfully shes shes saved from the lobotomty by the head nurse and shes sent to work at the night club thats run by this other sadistic man named Boyo and where the girl who gets the nickmname babydoll when she gets there is forced to not only be trapped in the vocation that she obviously doesnt wanna be in but she also has to dance and satisfy some horny man that come in now it also takes so really creepy xxxof the fact that Emily Browning in this movie looks like shes underage even though I know for su for a fact that shes not underage in real life and movie itself says shes twenty but I dont know Ill get to that in a little bit anyway Babydolls than forced to dance for the first time by by the order of the dance instructor there the dance coordinator whos played by Carla Gugino and when she dances she goes into this alternate world that kind of looks like video game in a certain way in fact the first time she goes in it looks like a Japanese temple and later time she goes like a World War II battlefield um castle this kind of pulled out of Lord of the Rings anyway the first time she goes in she meets this prophet whos played by Scott Glenn and he tells her that she can escape from the world shes in by collecting a group of items and than one other itam that is shell gonna have to find out for herself what that is throat cleaning anyway so she gets the idea that hey we can escape and she tries to get the other girls who are dancing at the night club to and also trapped there to join in and shes able to and basically the rest of the movie is them going into or going back into babydolls dream worlds to try and collect all these items even though they are actually collecting the items within the real world and actually theres a lot of things going on as far as whats in Babydolls mind whats in her mind within her mind in a way its kind of like inception in that way its kind of playing with the idea whats real whats not what the Matrix films did although actually the best comparison this is this film would actually be something like Pans Labyrinth
