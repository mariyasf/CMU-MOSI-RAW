hey everyone welcome to Toppers movie review so its Friday January 8 and last week I went and saw Alvin and the chipmunks 2 you know what normally I do a review right after I saw the movie but for this one I just didnt feel like it um I loved the very first Alvin and the chipmunks movie because it had a real nostalgic feel to it it reminded me of getting up on a Saturday morning and eating fruit loops and um watching cartoons but you know for this one I just didnt care um I saw no reason why they needed to bring back the villain from the first one and um while the trailer made the film look real nice and cute it was just flat um Im sure kids are gonna love it kids are gonna love the film I mean its a its a you know CGI Chipmunk movie and they sing and they play songs from todays top ten but for me I was just a little bored sure there were cute money parts in the mixting of the film but otherwise I dont know I didnt even care for it but you go check it out and you let me know what you
