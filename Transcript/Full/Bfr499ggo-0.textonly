 Lets talk Sex and the City 2 snap Most of the critics are right It just really heh but if you loved the series and you also liked xxx the first movie than youre still gonna have fun just go in with low expectaions If your pet pees Carrie wore those horrendous hideous hats they were not catching the ball and a few times I didnt like the fashion A few times I thought that was bumped way over the top and they kind of looked like clowns The desert scene was one of them um but you know the premise is OK and there are a few nice moments The movie is really too long they shouldve just cut the wedding in the beginning its not even necessary for the plot I also thought that desert riding the camels all troup stopped looking like clowns But also not necessary but I love the moment with Charlotte in the closet because who hasnt experienced that although I ran to the bathroom and um It was just fun to see your old friends again so if your a fan Id do it but dont expect much the writing isnt as good as the first the storyline isnt this good but if you dont expect a lot I think youll enjoy it And thats it Now off to bed
