 so im gonna talk about the movie something borrowed featuring kate hudson uh jennifer goodwin that one dude from the office and a guy who looks a lot like tom cruise um lip smacking this movie is dumb uh i personally think its a waste of money just because i cant stand movies that are so predictable laughing i just just cant stand movies where its like the same plot as like 50 other million movies just different just different people playing the roles i really dont care to see those but you know what i took a chance you know i like kate hudson so i thought this movie would be funny and dont get me wrong there were you know funny parts in the movie i just dont care for the plot i dont care for basically any of it because its predictable so the plot is jennifer goodwin her name is rachel shes the only character in the movie that i knew the name of because i really am oblivious to life and dont pay attention to things so rachel is this underdog kind of girl her best friend kate hudson um steals her um college um law school crush um you know mr dreamy whatever not real anyways lip smacking so she steals him and uh couple years later theyre gonna get married what happens basically is that um she has sex with her best friends fiance which is her law school crush they just go at it in the back of a cab which is if i was the cab driver i would of just pull over and kick them out because i would never deal with people making out in the back of my cab um anyways that has nothing to do with the movie so you can pretty much already guess whats gonna happen uh you know during this movie its the same you know rise and fall the underdog you know she gets the guy but shes in trouble you know cuz she doesnt wanna tell her best friend blah blah blah and then uh she loses the guy because the guy doesnt wanna make a decision whether or not he wants uh rachel or her best friend and so shes all sad walking in the rain blah blah blah and then she gets the guy back and then her best friend sleeps with like this one dude named like marcus or something and uh shes pregnant with his baby and blah blah blah ive been saying that a lot in this video blah blah blah blah um yea so anyways its really predictable i mean you can go see i personally didnt like it because i just got really bored with it um and its really unpredictable i just get so tired of unpredictable movies like these guys in the
