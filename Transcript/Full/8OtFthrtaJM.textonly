 hey hows it going guys I went to go see the Adjustment Bureau Friday so I thought Id give you guys a review for those of you who may have not seen it and maybe wished to see it right just as a little synopsis the main character played by Matt Damon he falls in love with the girl in a bathroom which is where all great relationships should start um you know these two people fall in love with each other but theres this higher organization called the adjustment bureau and they try to adjust adjust their lives each other persons life to keep them away from each other because that what it says in the plan this plan that they are following so Matt Damon um desides not to do that and he wants to live with the girl anyways and so you know hes trying to run away from the adjustment bureau and theyre theyre chasing him and theres running theres a lot of doors opening and closing and theres fedoras and just its very its very chaotic at the end of this movie I literally said out loud what que what is this movie that I am seeing what is this I do not understand this movie but theres a reason for that theres a reason for why I was confused first off the commercial makes the terrible terrible mistake of saying that it is more thought provoking than Inception thanks a lot commercial the entire time I was constantly comparing it to Inception but I must say those are some pretty big shoes to fill so I thought maybe it has a chance I I should give it a shot you know I was just waiting for Joseph Gordon Levitt to come out just jump out any time and say its a paradox now the only suspensful part that I found in the first thirty minutes of the movie was when Matt Damon first discovers the Bureau in the first place you know ther theres a lot of confusion theres scuffling he hes trying to run away from them end up catching him and then they explain their purpose to him as to why they are there which kind of just ruins the suspense right there because if youve got some convenient guy in a fedora to just tell you oh yes we are the adjustement bureau and this is what we do you know its just kind of ruins the suspense and now Im not Im not excited anymore interestingly it turned out to be more of a romantic comedy than it was a thriller um you know it had some interesting writing you know it was it was funny at times Matt Damon is a you know hes a pretty funny guy but just aside from that they really dropped the ball on the suspensful parts overall overall it had far too many plot holes and just not enough depth to be interesting I have to say my favorite character in the entire movie is the character Thompson if you go see the movie youll see him but hes just the creepiest old guy youll ever see in your life he stands over people when theyre asleep just staring at them just imagine if youre in your bed sleeping and getting your dream on whatever you do you know and theres just someone standing at the foot of your bed just
