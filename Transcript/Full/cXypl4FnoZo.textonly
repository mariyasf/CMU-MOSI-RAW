 Hey guys um I saw Red Riding Hood finally xxx seeing Red Riding Hood for a really long time and um yeah me and Louis went yesterday and um Ill just say overall if I think it was good and than Ill say like some spoilers but um I liked it I thought it could be really bad um but it didnt look like it would be but It couldve been um I like did I thought Catherine Hardwicke did a good job and um I liked you know Catherine Hardwicke is like you know kind of ridiculous and she was kind of wierd during Twilight but um I I like seeing um female directors because there arent that many compare to you know guy directors so the more like women directors that I see you know I I I like seeing that so um I thought she did great with this movie um anyway I would say just you go and see it if you were thinking about seeing it but you werent sure if it would be worth seeing um I say go see it coz I I enjoyed it now um some spoilers I guess um yeah spoilers um I hm I dont like well I dont know if I wanna say I dont like this but I wish that it wouldve been different who the wolf actually turned out to be um I just I wouldve like me and Louis were saying we were thinking the whole time like who couldve be who couldve be um we had like we have guessed everybody um this like this random charecter dude who what does he do I dont remember I dont know how to like tell you who he is coz youre gonna be like that doesnt narrow it down at all Its just like this this character whos kind of random and he has brown hair and he I dont I think he maybe he got mad when hah I dont know um but yeah whatever um he we thought it would be him because they werent showing him a lot but they showed him enough to they kind of be like oh it was him in the end but it wasnt him um a I wish we wished that it wouldve been um the guy um oh my laptop is running out of battery um we wished it wouldve been Peter because it wouldve made sense throat cleaning that um Peter like we wanted to be that she knew um Amanda Seyfrieds character knew it was PEter but was pretending that she didnt so that she got a reason to run away with him and they could be together thats what we kind of thought and it would make sense and and we kind of wanted it to be like but exept not that obvoious but that wouldve been good right like coz that it would give tham a reason coz they wanted to get married but they couldnc because she was gonna marry the other guy and another thing the other guy she was supposed to marry was a hundred times better looking than Peter was nicer than Peter I was saying if shes not gonna marry him I will because she picked the wrong but anyway thats irrelevant um throat clearing coming below he thought he was really happy because I thought he was um Peter was annoying I didnt like Peter um but
