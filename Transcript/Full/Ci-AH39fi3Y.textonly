I just got back from the midnight showing of Saw 5 and I have to review before I go to sleep because Im still excited about it But I just want to let you guys know that the first part of this review will not have any spoilers and also you dont have to worry about it being ruind for you And the second half of this video is going to have spoilers but I will warn you beforehand so you can close out the video and than after you see Saw 5 you can come back and watch the spoilers Also be very vary of the comments underneath the video I would suggest that if you havent seen Saw 5 you shouldnt go to the comments because people are going to be commenting about the ending and stuff So if you havent seen Saw 5 dont check out the comments on this video either So hopefully you got all that now lets talk about Saw 5 As some of you might not notice I was extremly excited about Saw 5 OK all of you knew that obviously So I was you know really hyped up and excited to see it and I have to say that it was definately better than the Saw 4 not exectly what I was expecting but it was still really really really good and um its just made me really really excided for Saw 6 Now there were two plots going on in this movie One of them was great and the other one was completely irrelevant as far as I can tell The great plot was with Hoffman tying up all loose ends and stuff and the irrelevant plot was with five rendom strangers kind of like in Saw 2 who um you know have to go through these traps and stuff But I totally missed how it tied it to the movie at all and Im pretty sure thats because it didnt tie in to the movie at all So that was really bizzare and I didnt care about the characters at all because they werent you know introduced well really So it was just really really strange but luckily Hoffmans story um was a really really really awesome and um it totally made up for that so thats OK Of course as everyone knows the tag line of Saw 5 was you wont believe how it ends And I guess thats sort of true because I sure didnt see the end coming Im not gonna spoil it dont worry But the end was really you you know the Saw movies are known for it bigh twist endings and stuff but I thought the best part of Saw 5 was the storyline like in general Everything leading up to the ending the ending was not you know crazy shocking or anything like usual It was not a real huge Saw twist moment um so you know that was a little surprising I guess Thats not to say that the ending wasnt good because it really was but it was not exectly what I was expecting and se seriously everything leading up to the end was better than the ending which is still good because the movie is good Saw 5 has left like no closure at all at the end of the movie and it pretty much just left the door wide open for Saw 6 which obviously is already scheduled to come out next year So you know we knew it was coming and everything but man oh man it really left the door open and it didnt even you know try to close it at all like the wind isnt gonna blow it over or anything Its just open But like I said the plot of Hoffman and everything that was really really awesome and it fit very well into the Saw series in my opinion So congratulations to the writers for that But Ill smack them in the face for the other irrelevant plotline and dont know what the hell they were thinking It was pretty much just and excuse to put traps in the movie because it was literally completely irrelevant But whatever Like I said I loved the Hoffmans storyline so you know I guess it balances out David Hackl directed this movie and it was his first time directing a movie I think in general
