 Ok so tonight I went and saw the movie Crazy stupid love or what I would like to call Rayan Gosling leather shoe and suit porn Now before I get in to the movie review which as you guys all know is mostly xxx talking about movie review but I actually really FUCKING love this movie So theres not gonna be any of bad shit But before a I talk about the movie I wanna talk about a preview very quickly So there was a movie out and it stared every mother fucker in Hollywood Now automatically goes like oh VALENTINES DAY no New Years fucking eve WHAT are they doing with those stupid cliche movies about love revolving around holidays And they always pick stupid ass holidays Whats next Thanksgiving afternoon fucking Harbor day fucking Flag day Why do they keep making those stupid movies with every mother fucker thats in Hollywood and are always crappy and Im just sitting up here like God damn it I would only see this movie for xxx xxx so anyway the movie was really fucking awesome I think that that they personally thought that Rachel Withers really fucking love suits and Ryan Gosling so they made this movie with me in mind Like Im dead fucking serious No really like Rachel Whiters needs some fucking fat material they were like fucking Rachel ass waitress loves leather shoes on men Especially men that look like Ryan S Gosling I wish I was Ryan Gosling Ryan Gosling The best part in the movie Im not gonna fucking spoil anything for you just because that would be rude and you should all go out and see it and you know stuff Best part of the fucking ass movie was this one scene where Ryan Gosling was just standing there in a fucking suit eating pizza in slow ass motion that was just like hu like zooming in on him and Im just like sitting here like any mother fuckers drop Emma Stone was in this movie as well and you wouldnt really know it coz she was hardly in it and I was really upset about it coz you know apparently according to people on the internet aka tumbler because everyone on tumbler is on crack they all think I look like her or like sound like her or act like her I dont know I guess we both have like that like mm male sounding voice Like I kind of sound like I might have a penis And yeah I know we both have that like an easy way we both have red hair we both like flooged in shit and its like maybe but like in this movie she had brown hair and she didnt really act like me at all and I was kind of upset about it because like she mustve been an animal and she wasnt and I was thinkin like if I can be mother fucking Emma Stone and Chris can be Royan Gosling and that would be just great didnt really happen in the movie I was kind of upset about that theres a giant ass twist to this movie at the end like Its obviosly not like a serious fucking movie or anything Its comedy romantic romcom raoa Im a little disappointed in myself for not realising the twist before it actually twisted because like what the fuck like thats what Im good at Im gonna spoil skins right now I totally knew Manny and Rick were gonna be related I fucking knew it like I knew it I knew that inception that they were gonna be dreaming um Im fucking kidding right now So Im gonna go download the soundtrack in like five minutes and Im pretty sure Flee Fox is on it and if its not I just had really bad ears but I kind of thought it was Flee Fox I dont know but it was a realy good movie really good soundtrack and if you really really like Ryan Gosling and fucking like
