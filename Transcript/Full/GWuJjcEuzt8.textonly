 OK so hi everyone this is my first movie review so I watched Burlesque the past week and well it was another movie considering you know thats theres not much xxx video in Singapore to lease so um first things first Christina Aguileras xxx I swear the xxx xxx um why I said that is because she is god a crazy crazy voice and she sure can sing really really well in this movie you know she sings tough love and you know the classic songs and you know it makes you wanna know who else you know in the history of nowadays has the voice like that and you know its noone xxxit you know that she gets to choose the song because shes the executive music producer in the movie so you know she should be next xxx voice anyway next would be Cher who has been away for like probably centuries I think but you know she my mom says shes probably like 60 70 years old but she still looks like shes 48 and her face doesnt move at all coz when you see her face moves it feels like you know you feel worried for her you feel like her face is going to fall apart and overall the movies quite entertaining that the dancers um wonderful its sexy but not slutty you know theres not much of nudity exept for you know for the male lead who is drop dead gorgeous by the way but Im the girl so thats not the point the point is um the songs in the movie are wonderful you know it matches the whole theme of the movie you know cabaret and you know the looks and overall probably Id give it about 35 stars you know popcorn movie and you know considering all the awesome movies that we had and xxx Inception the Black Swan and you know the Social Network this one you know probably in the middle so 35 stars and if you have money to spend go ahead
