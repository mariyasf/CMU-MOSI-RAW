So I went to the premiere of the Christmas Carol It was amazing the premiere itself was really cool but Im gonna tell you about that in another video because otherwise this video will be mega mega long This video is about the film itself and I actually liked the film a lot and I wasnt expecting to because I thought how the hell is Dickens and Disney gonna work together like this So kind of opposite but I thought they actually worked pretty well If you dont know the story that well its all about guy this old guy called Scrooge whos really mean and he never spends any money on anyone and I guess visited by these three ghosts the ghost of Christams past the ghost of Christmas present and the ghost of Christmas yet to come and they show him you know what his life has been like what it is like now what is going to be like if he keeps being like he is But yeah than he changes his ways and xxxin the end and the end part is really really funny because hes been such a grumpy character and hes really scared and in the end hes so changed and hes really funny hes like what a delightful child and its all kind of its hard to explain but if you see it than youll understand what I mean the animation was amazing I wasnt expecting that much because sometimes 3D isnt really that good but it was fenomenal you kind of forget about the fact that it is 3D the voices are really good that was one of my other concerns was that as an English person I get really annoyed when American shows and films have an English character but than its so obviously not an English character but yeah generally the accents were really really good so good one you America for doing that hah America the the land that made this film what else I doubt that theyre gonna do this for all the screenings because it was the premiere On each seat there was the um a bottle of water a bar of chocolate and a bag of humbugs I would not have chosen to go and see that but Im really really really glad I saw it and I would recommend it to other people its true even though I was like hu Im gonna hate it but Im just gonna have to say it Its my favorite film ever um its not my favorite film ever but I would definately watch it again I can imagine getting this on DVD and watching it at Christmas at time because it makes you feel so like huh its not about commercialization its about you know families being together Anyway next video is going to be the footage from the thing and Ill tell you all about like the cool premiere and stuff and Im sorry its over the mid way but I just wanted to put this up soon Hes xxxtakes of me trying to make this video early on which were um a disasterous so enjoy and yes see you next video throat cleaning um singing coughing whats wrong with me laughter amazing
