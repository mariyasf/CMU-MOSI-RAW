much say that I really enjoyed Cowboys and Aliens There was a lot of fun You guys dont know what youre gonna go and see when you go walk into the movie called Cowboys and Aliens If youre expecting some artsy serious Oscar contender than youre wrong The only Oscar that I can even thing of is maybe like best cinematography Because the cinematography in this movie is great and maybe best visual effects coz the visual effects are pretty cool But again you you cant expect a huge like surreal mind bender from the movie called Cowboys and Aliens yo youre gonna see cowboys fighting aliens and you get it here and its satisfactory The action is really intense which surprised me I didnt expect the action to be so intense Theres some really intense action scenes especially the scene when the aliens first invade That scene is like crazy It gave me chills i its a lot of fun the action is really cool The aliens are really cool OK Im not gonna spoil what they look like one thing I like with the aliens is that a they are not just weak links that hide behind the technology They are huge theyre really strong and theyre kind of scary looking I didnt expect that and also I like how its kind of upfront to show them to us instead of hiding them like showing a little like an arm on scene or something no they just straight up show it to us And I really enjoyed that I it was really cool when they did that coz the aliens were really cool looking Daniel Craig does a very good job here He kind of channels the man with no name Clint Eastwood and a lot of people have been saying that I think he does a great job at what he does Hes a really bad ass is really really hard core He doesnt take crap from anybody and he does a really good job Also his innocent accent is pretty convincing Harrison Ford is also good Hes he gives an entertaining performance as the kind of like the leader the of the town hes like an outlaw leader but everyones kind of afraid of him and he at first hes just kind of like grumpy old guy but he becomes more likeable his guts developed more as more likeable character so you can care about him and alsoum Olivia Wild shes pretty good shes beautiful and shes not a bad actor shes actually pretty good Shes in everything nowadays Dont flaw There are some flaws here and there but theyre not huge glaring flaws but they are noticable flaws Such as sometimes the aliens in the western setting do look a little goofy but I was kind of expecting that um theres a plot twist Im not gonna reveal I wasnt a huge fan of it I just thought it was kind of stupid and sometimes it kind of veers into cliche action movie territory like a movie called Cowboys and Aliens a lot of people would think would be kind of like crazy but sometimes it just veers entirely cliche action movie territory again not a huge flaw but its there and its noticable Overall I really enjoyed Cowboys and Aliens and Im gonna give it an eight out of ten It was really fun a very good time and I definately recommend you check it out in theaters coz thats th
