hey guys I told you that I would make a review for the movie Sex and the city 2 whats Im gonna do Im gonna start off with saying that I really wasnt very impressed with the movie um I watched a lot of the series and I own the first movie and I liked the first movie I thought the first movie was really good but this movie kind of came off like somebodys really sad travel video I dont know I mean that sounds really harsh but I just wasnt I just I dont know I didnt really like the movie all that much I mean I had some some good moments and a few funny parts but all in all I just thought it was really over overly sad I dont know I just thought I just thought it was really really sad um I mean if you really like the show and you really liked the first movie and you still wanna go and see this Im not gonna discourage you from seeing it I just personally I just didnt really enjoy it um it also really didnt need a lot of the things that it had in it like it couldve been shorter um its like over two hours but a lot of the footage was kind of unnecessary and I mean I dont know I just I feel like I dont mean if I have wasted those two hours I just feel like I couldve done something better with them I think that Charlotte and Miranda have some really nice moments in the movie I really think that I really like the Mirandas character actually the most upbeat character in the whole movie I think that um and that everybody I do feel really bad for Charlotte she does have a lot of issues and you really can kind of symphatize whether youve got to have kids I mean even if you dont have kids because its just just about getting getting time for yourself and not being really stressed out and I think that thats thats a very relatable issue I think that they all have like a lot of issues and that some are very relatable yeah I mean it it has some fun moments but all in all wasnt really that big of a fan I mean Im not gonna do like a spoiler section Im not gonna like and indeapth thing because there really wasnt all that much to it for me um like I said if you like it feel free to go see it I just personally wasnt that into it um yeah I mean if you wanna see a video um its gonna be who enjoyed a film if you do wanna see somebody whos possibly critiquing it Ill put a link for for the video um somewhere up here um its by um its Jill Strip and she really enjoyed the film um so if you like to hear a um like more positive review check out her review it is very good um just two of us in opinions but yeah I wanna talk about La rue for a second major laser I dont know if you guys are familiar with major laser but major laser and la rue and various others have collaborated um
