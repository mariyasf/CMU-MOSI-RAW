 Cowboys and Aliens metaphoricaly speaking is like one of those NFL teams that has the talent to be a super bowl champion but instead ends up being a wild cart team that just gets dismissed in the first round of playoffs yeah job pretty well done I mean it wasnt a bad year but there was a lot of potential left on the table And that describes Cowboys and Aliens pretty well Though I guess I should be grateful that it turned out as good as it did because given all the strikes that it had going against before wonder production it could have been much much worse Fortunally some good decisions were made before the camara started rolling Jon Favreau was hired to direct and Daniel Craig and Harisson Ford were cast as the lead roles but this probably had the unfortunate side effect of raising bad expectations to unreasonable levels When I saw the first trailer back in November of last year this movie immediately shot up near the top of my list of must see movies for 2011 The final product ultimately doesnt live up to the high order of that first trailer but its still a pretty enjoyable ride if you go in wanting to see a bunch of cowboys battle a bunch of aliens yeah youll pretty much get your fill but if thats all youre looking for youll actually miss the best thing about this movie Jon Favreau is probably not the guy that I would hire if I was looking for a director for an action movie I mean yeah hes a competent action director hes action sequences are certainly a lot better than the incoherent impossible to follow slope that we see in a typical Michael Bay movie but its action isnt particulary memorable I mean lets look at his track record Hes directed three big action movies in the last three years Two Ironman films and now this And the action wasnt the most memorable thing about any on those movies The ironman films are fondly remembered mostly for Robert Doweny Jr Not the action And the same thing has more or less happened here yeah thats right the movie called Cowboys and Aliens Daniel Craig steels the whole damn show hes playing a variation of the iconic man with no name character that was made famous by Clint Eastwood and now that Ive seen him in the role I cant imagine any other current actor trying ot pull it off He is perfect from start to finsih Harisson Ford is a long for the ride and having a blast as the second lead and the cast is pretty well rounded out with suppordting performance from guys like Sam Rockwell as the Doc Theyre all playing cliched stock western characters but I really dont care that the characters are walking cliches when they are this well done and the actors do such a good job of carrying of their particular arcs Cowboys and Aliens problem is the screenplay Six different people got writing credit for this movie and the results are exactly what you would expect the story
