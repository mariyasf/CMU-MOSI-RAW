music all right I just watched the Watchman yes I was watching the Watchman um lets see it was a few words describe it um graphics were incredible um some really good acting some really sucky acting um blue penis youre like what what did you just say um yeah blue penis all right let me explain OK um the guy thats blue in the movie Dr Manhattan um hes naked so this was pretty funny coz people were like eating popcorn and you see the first show and people you hear like this this ripple effect of whispering oh my god is that a is that am I looking at this right what I thought that was really funny um there couldve been less blue nudity because what was weird was the fact that in part of the movie hes wearing like a blue um overall flong thing medal flong thing so I was like why not wear the whole whole time you know why why you got to go command on us it was funny though hes funny um theres other nudity in it it was like people that arent blue um thats all right I dont know its kind of weird naked up on spaceship I dont know classic superhero kind of getting on kind of thing all right so enough of the nudity lets hear about the story lets talk about the acting um but what sucked what was bad was Malin Akerman the girl who plays the Silk Spectre II um junior lady girl I know I I mean she looked fan fantastic she looked phenomenal she looked like a superhero but she acted like power ranger and theres a vast difference between those two things but Ill tell you what Ill tell you who made the movie who was just kick ass 100 of time was the guy that played our Rorschach I dont know if Im saying that right Rorschach ror Rorschach I think it is a Rorschach but anyways he was awesome hes the little guy with the white mask and implants on it that change all the time I thought that was very cool um he was awesome like he was incredible the other guy that did a really good job was um Jeffrey Dean Morgan the guy who played the comedian he did a very good job very dark um I really liked sicko guy but um he did a really good job at acting I was very impressed so overall its its like a blend of youve got alternative history youve got multi multiple different time periods mixed together um but different genres and its very very interesting um but its extremely dark I warn you its a very very dark and um theres not in my opinion there wasnt very much of a balance between sort of like the good evil kind of thing and it seemed like everything was sort of overwhelmingly bad um so at the end theres not really a whole lot of redeeming value that I think you come up with but um you know overall it was good I have to say
