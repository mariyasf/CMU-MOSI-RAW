Robin Hood starring Russel Crow um first thing I got to say xxx I was dreading going in to see this movie the trailers werent really doing it much for me see neither are folks too much on epic than you know character development of this timeless tale that is Robin Hood and also therere these reviews I was reading about it I maen I think the most generous review Ive read give it two out of five so I really was not looking forward to seeing this movie um but I guess say maybe my expectations were lowered by these other reviews that I read but I didnt mind it to be honest with you um I know its been a really just getting nail to cross as far as I you know movies going on a film festival right now but I didnt find it all that bad I didnt find it all that good like I said maybe my expectations were lowered because of all of those reviews but I really didnt hate it um I guess well start right off like what people could hate about this movie there are some negatives to say the least um really first and foremost it just lacked the charm of these past Robin Hood movies that we know I mean there was this classic Disney verstion which everyone watched when we were kids um theres men in tights which you know hilarious spoof of the story theres a Kevin Costner prince of fee version which was supposed to be the dark and edgy version of his time I mean but that was what thirteen years ago fourteen years ago probably more than that so maybe in Hollywoods eyes it was time for a remake and it just lacked the charm of those past movies it did seem to focus too much on epic epic epic and it really just lacked what made the other movies more enjoyable and suffers from what I call kingdom of heaven syndrom where it builds too much for these huge catastrophic war sequences theyre supposed to blow you away but the problem is you dont give a damn because it just lacks that charm of the past movies um not in all instances but the ones that matter the most yeah um Russel Crow and Cate Blanchette just did not sell it for me I had a very hard time just buying it like were supposed to believe that these two are in their mid wel you know mid thirties at the oldest and laughter theyre looking pretty rough in this movie like OK yeah Russel Crow is Robin Hood whos a crusaider and hes got back from a crusaids I can appreciate that hes not gonna be looking like a chipper bright young man but early thirties really you want me to buy that I cant do it especially when hes hanging around with a married men who all but one of them are probably early twenties laughter and one of them is maybe mid twenties and meanwhile theyre hanging in with papa Russel it just looks like you know its bunch of a guys hanging there so one brought dad along coz he offered to drive
