the verdict is stupid and a complete waste of money not mine I mean sort of mine but it was a fun experience going like I didnt expect it to be good but its just such a waste of money for them like when I see the movie thats obviously had a very big budget and it is like not even good it makes me angry coz Im just like why are you wasting so much money aaaaa it wasnt even holding my attention I could barely stay awake through the movie I honestly wanted the aliens to win and Im gonna talk spoilers now all the characters were just so unlikable just there was only one character the doctor he was the only person I even really cared about and even he was a douchebag all of them every single cowboy was just a complete douchebag and there was just this little boy and he was the only person who wasnt a douchebag but he wasnt even interesting his mom was dead and his dad hadnt seen him a year so like I really like supposed to feel a little bad for him or something but they gave him no no character like he had no character development whatsoever he was just like a plot device for this other guy to start acting like a father figure and he was just stupid but then he didnt even act like a father figure towards him he was just like oh I shall be your father figure but then I realize I should be a father to my own son goodbye child and Harrison Ford from the trailers for some reason I got the idea that he was a sheriff but he was actually complete douchebag who just ran the town with his business Daniel Craigs character so he had like amnesia right like an am someone who has amnesia like usually theyre like really confused just like you know vulnerable and this guy was like the complete opposite he didnt know what was going on so he just killed everyone he met like I dont know whats going on Im confused so Im just gonna kill you all why are you killing everyone it just some people were like oh hes so cool hes so awesome like youve never seen that in the movie this person who had amnesia just kills everybody even if its like but that was so unnecessary whay are you killing these people you dont even know whats going on like dude get over yourself he looked awesome while he did it but yeah OK so let all the girls who want all disagree with me coz they all think this is an amazing movie but they all think he was amazing because they were staring at Daniel Craig the whole time theyr going oh my gosh hes so hot all the guys that went were pretty much on my page they were just like wow that was stupid wow so I sat with the guys the girls set up higher than I did I sat with the guys and we all try to stay awake through it um and kept falling asleep and then talk about how stupid it was it was Cowboys and aliens but theres a reason they didnt call it cowboys versus aliens coz the cowboys and the aliens they dont they barely even fight at all coz thay cant like the cowboys s stand no chance all it is is like Daniel Craigs character has this thing that can blow them up oh goody for him then they get Indians involved and the Indians the ca
