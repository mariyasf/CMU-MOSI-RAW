bang this is a one minute review of How to train your dragon currently in theaters so I took my daughters and one of their friends to the movies on Friday afternoon after school to watch How to train your dragon and between the four tickets the 3D upcharge and the slushies and popcorn I spent over 75 dollars that has nothing to do with the movie I just wanted to let you know that 3D is really ridiculously expensive How to train your dragon you know what you should see How to train your dragon you should take your kids and if you dont have kids you may wanna consider seeing it anyway its probably the best thing currently in theaters it is its a great story its a lot of fun to watch its beautifully done and its really well written I have two problems with it I will now tell you what they are Number one Im getting a little sick of the xxx kind of lead character sort of really awkward boy who is really awkward and stuff you know Im getting sick of that character and Im tired of it and I get angry about it laughter xxx doesnt play best character in the film but he might as well so Im Im Im through with that guy second theres one massive plot hole in this film and it is the size of a dragon that is big as a mountain and when you see the film youll probably know what I mean um theres no explanation for this thing and the only explanation I come up with makes this story kind of kind of creepy because theres a metro sign other then those two things this is a really fun film that you will enjoy unless you are soleless piece of machenery so have fun with How to train your dragon music
