hissing Im back sorry for the long wait I really have no justification for why Ive been gone for so long I mean I havent really seen that many movies since 127 hours but I just I dont know I couldnt master the will power to make a video Im really really sorry but I can promise you Im back for good now you know why because I saw five movies today and the one of them the first one is what Im going to review to xxx you guys right now it is Tron legacy this movie has been hyped up for months and months Disney has been marketing that crap out of this movie I I mean its just its literally been everywhere main draw for me for this movie was just the fact that its set in this like ridiculous world with all these bright beautiful colors and ridiculous action sequences Tron Legacy is this sequel to the 1982 classic Tron and I dont think thats a very good movie but I do think its a very interesting one its a first movie that used like legitimate special effects like um like they use computers like to generate part of the movie and that have not been done before ever and considering the first movie was a massive innovation theres obviously a lot of expectations of this one um you know Disney poured at least 300 million into this movie um a lot of expectations where writing on it so what do I think of Tron Legacy I can tell you that Tron Legacy is not a good movie but I was still ridicilously entertained by it are these two things possible in the same sentanceI I really do think so let me um th just let me explain tron Legacy is a movie where on most counts that I judge movies it kind of fails the performances are nah the script can be horrible its its a bit of a mixed bag coz there were some very bright moments um the direction is a bit its wobbly basically a lot of elements that I could take a movie on its really wobbly but what it lacks in those areas it most definately makes up for just like sheer visual spectacle I mean this movie has the most gorgeous visuals out of any movies since probably Avatar me if not prettier so many moments in this movie that are just framed and lit so perfectly that so that you just go like kind of huh thats really really cool and then take that world that have been set like a crap tunnel of really kinetic really well done action sequences in it and you have Tron Legacy I I cant belive I havent like explained the plot of this movie yet so its set literally inside the computer it it doesnt make much sense I know and basically um theres this kid named Sam flinth um um hes dad was a head of a big coorporation and then he disappeared twenty years ago and for whatever reason Sam um he gets a page telling him to go to an old araade that his dad owned and basically this makes no sense but he ends up in the computer um and there he basically has to fight his way out to survive but then he finds his dad in an also
