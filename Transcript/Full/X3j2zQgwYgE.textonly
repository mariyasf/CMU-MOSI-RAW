 Lets talk Shrek Ever After Um lip smacking Not great The gist of the story is that Shrek is tired of his life now married with the kids so he really would like to relive his glory days He goes to Rumplestiltskin and signs a contract that in order to have a free day where he can relive his glory stuff he will give a day Unbeknownst to Shrek Rumplestiltskin takes the day that he was born so then Shrek doesnt exist And in order to get things back to how they were he has to um get Fiona to fall in love with him and they have to once again have true loves first kiss Sigh I really think what this was missing was that humor and that wit that than the other Shrek movies Um its just not there Its okay But its really not wonderful Nothing to rush out and see There arent a lot of kids movies out right now so and I guess normally Shrek is for adults but lack you know very lackluster Anyway Thats it Chuckle be forewarned Low expectations Okay And now its late so off to bed Ciao
