Im a big fan of the first Tron Um i thought this is the perfect time to have a Tron sequel because um in at the beginning of the 1980s people thought that computers can do every every anything and everything and now technology actually does anything and everything because it kinda controls our lives so it was the perfect time for a Tron sequel unfortunately um the writers and I were not exactly on the same wavelength lip smacking but I will say that the first third of this movie is amazing its the best summer movie Ive seen all year but you know the pacing is so good it gets straight into the story you have lots of uh references to the first movie you know you have recurring characters you have new characters that actually have a connection to the old ones and once Sam Flynn enters the grid you know the soundtrack draws you in the special effects look amazing uh they dont waste a lot of time on exposition because the minute the soundplane enters the grid he is put in the games and let me tell you the games look great all those action sequences in involving the games were great to watch um the cho the choreography of the fights the special effects I was so happy to be back in the grid that I wasnt really thinking about the story or where the story was going but then sam flynn meets his father and Tron basically turns into a star wars prequel after that one disconnection then that happens at that point because uh the old flynn the original flynn starts going on and on about these kinds of aliens not aliens artifical intelligence i guess that he found on the grid and he just pulls them the writers just pull this out of their ass and the whole movie becomes about these crazy i i isos theyre calles ISOs and its just like or why do we need these things it doesnt make any sense because anyway they get purged at some point because when the old Flynn finds these things whatever they are theyre so wise and naive kinda like Navi now that I think about it clue which is the program that he created in the first movie kinda pulls a bunny in the boiler moment in the sense that he turns into a crazy jealous psycho stalker bitch and clue has to be one of the most idiotic villains ever cause what is a what is clue clue is a computer program and he wants to take all the programs that are now under his control and put them in the real world for some kind of freaky teleportation or whatever so basically you have this computer program that wants to create a physical army on the planet and its like youre a computer program okay if you want to take over the world using real people its the worst way you could possibly do that infiltrate some computer system somewhere and detonate some nukes or something
