 hi this is my frist reviw in like ever um I just saw the Clash of the titans movie it couldve been better the first one was a lot better They couldve made Zeus a little less sparkly it was very distracting um it was very hard to follow the first one made more sense and the crackon you know in the preview is like so much hype they pretend theres gonna be this big scene it maybe lasts about a minute and I was like is that it and than its definatelly not a 3D movie the previews are much more 3D the ne so yeah it was very disappointing I give it about one and a half stars so thats thumbs down if you dont understand so it is not a buy but the CGI was great and thats exectly how I thought a giant scorpion would look with the piece of driftwood that had blue fire on it um Medusa was way different from Percy Jackson and Glandon Laws which BTW Im getting tomorrow because I got 100 dollars for doing an essay so yeah throat cleaning but the best part about the movie I ve got a free pair of glasses and you might be a like well they tell you to recycle hahaha haha so kind Im saving the environment coz they have to run this through pure alcohol then just xxx plastic but repackaging it so Im saving the environment I just reduced my carp and footprint by stealing this glasses
