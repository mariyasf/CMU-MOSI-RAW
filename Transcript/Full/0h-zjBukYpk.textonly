 huh huh OK OK hello this is xxx man eleven here for review of XMen Origins Wolverine throat cleaning starring Hugh Jackman Liev Schreiber Danny Houston Ryan Reynolds Will I am and Taylor Kitsch and yes I just watched this a week ago most specifically July 27 so who ran off for over 3 dollar theater showings now the title of the movie basically says it all the movie shows the origins and backstory of famed Xman member Wolverine now Im not even gonna sugar coat this this movie frustrated me to such an extreme extent that I was loudly exclaiming why at the end of the film my reason Im a comic book fan that like to see comic book characters treated responsibly that huh before we go on with that I must say that this had a surprisingly decent cast strange since one of my biggest grapes with the Xman series was and always is the xxx now Hugh Jackman was always the best choice to play Wolverine I will admit that and in my opinion he carried the movie fine you know nothing great but you know he did it hes a star of the movie nothing special he carried it um also Liev Schreiber or Schreiber um I like calling him Liev Schreiber um is Victor Creed otherwise best known as Sabertooth which shes not called once in the whole movie which is a smart move since you know you have to be real comic book fan to get what hes name is supposed to be but its pretty selfexplanatory but going on um I actually think that Liev Schreiber is a good actor and he almost looks exactly the same as this character in Defiance I mean it was like he was too lazy to take off the costume or something now other performances are borderline OK but the two big character appearances in this movie are easily Deadpool and Gambit um Deadpool being Ryan Raynolds and Gambit being played by Taylor Kitsch Taylor Kitsch yes Ryan Raynolds has eleven minutes of screen time maximum actually I liked him a lot and I thought he made a good actor for the dead poor character now hes seen at the beginning that really sold me I mean that was impressive I liked that scene where he had a swords in there and theres bunch of people that are gonna shoot him boom boom boom boom take him down take him down bam bam bam bam bam take that with my magical swords
