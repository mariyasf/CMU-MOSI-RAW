 hi everyone welcome to Toffers movie review so its Saturday June 7 and just like said last night I went out today to see Kung fu panda so heres what I thought I was a little bit disappointed in the film the movie does star Jack Black um courses his voice over for a panda who wants to learn kung fu and become a famous dragon master and basically save the world now thats his life long dream now his father who by the way is a duck Um has a dream for him of becoming the owner of the noodle shop um now of course there is an all star cast that has Angelina Jolie Jackie Chan Lucy Liu Seth Rogan all of course that have voice over parts but the movie itself was just a little dry it didnt have a whole out of humor going on with it at least none that really made you wanna laugh out loud um even the kids and the audience itself just kind of chuckled a little bit gave a few laughs now Im not gonna lie therere a few parts that have great action sequences now even though it is an animated film it did have some great fight scenes um but as far as humor goes not as much as I was expecting everything you see in the trailer itself was pretty much all the humor youre gonna see in the movie um um a you know along with the xxx I would probably saying go see this movie an early showing dont spend a lot of money for the night viewing um maybe better like next time Dreamworks but for this one for me it just wasnt what I was hoping it would be I love the Shrek films I liked Ants but as far as Kung fu panda goes I was hoping for a lot more It just wasnt there for me I dont know next weekend um we have the Happening coming out and the Incredible hawk so maybe next week Ill have some better reviews for you
