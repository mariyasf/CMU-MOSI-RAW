 hi the Smurfs are back and in 3D I like this movie at first I thought the movie would appeal more to younger audience but I actually found myself enjoying the movie and laughing if you havent seen the Smurfs TV series the movie is about how a group of little blue people come to New York after trying to escape from the evil Gargamel they befriend a couple named Patrick and Grace since they let them stay at their appartment if youre wondering how the Smurfs will avoid Gargamel and get back to their magical world watch the movie to find out I think the movie really depicted the liveliness of New York City while since Im a New Yorker myself I also liked how the storyline of the movie worked together smoothly the movie also delivers many meaningful messages the Smurfs learn the importance of team work and Patrick learns to believe in himself and follow his heart I also thought some parts of the movie were funny for example um Gargamels cat facial expressions theyre so hilarious and similar to xxx person with that I recommend this film to children six and up it is a fun family film parents will find themselves laughing as they reminisce they childhood and children will like the movie since the Smurfs are so adorable and they go on thrilling adventures this has been a review from Gabriela Choo for Kids first bye
