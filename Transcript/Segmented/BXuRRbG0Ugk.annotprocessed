1_DELIM_COWBOYS AND ALIENS METAPHORICALY SPEAKING IS LIKE ONE OF THOSE NFL TEAMS THAT HAS THE TALENT TO BE A SUPER BOWL CHAMPION BUT INSTEAD ENDS UP BEING A WILD CART TEAM THAT JUST GETS DISMISSED IN THE FIRST ROUND OF PLAYOFFS
2_DELIM_YEAH JOB PRETTY WELL DONE
3_DELIM_I MEAN IT WASNT A BAD YEAR
4_DELIM_ BUT THERE WAS A LOT OF POTENTIAL LEFT ON THE TABLE
5_DELIM_ AND THAT DESCRIBES COWBOYS AND ALIENS PRETTY WELL
6_DELIM_ THOUGH I GUESS I SHOULD BE GRATEFUL THAT IT TURNED OUT AS GOOD AS IT DID
7_DELIM_BECAUSE GIVEN ALL THE STRIKES THAT IT HAD GOING AGAINST BEFORE WONDER PRODUCTION IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MUCH WORSE
8_DELIM_ FORTUNALLY SOME GOOD DECISIONS WERE MADE BEFORE THE CAMARA STARTED ROLLING
9_DELIM_BUT THIS PROBABLY HAD THE UNFORTUNATE SIDE EFFECT OF RAISING BAD EXPECTATIONS TO UNREASONABLE LEVELS
10_DELIM_ WHEN I SAW THE FIRST TRAILER BACK IN NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR THIS MOVIE IMMEDIATELY SHOT UP NEAR THE TOP OF MY LIST OF MUST SEE MOVIES FOR 2011
11_DELIM_ THE FINAL PRODUCT ULTIMATELY DOESNT LIVE UP TO THE HIGH ORDER OF THAT FIRST TRAILER
12_DELIM_ BUT ITS STILL A PRETTY ENJOYABLE RIDE IF YOU GO IN WANTING TO SEE A BUNCH OF COWBOYS BATTLE A BUNCH OF ALIENS YEAH YOULL PRETTY MUCH GET YOUR FILL
13_DELIM_BUT IF THATS ALL YOURE LOOKING FOR YOULL ACTUALLY MISS THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE
14_DELIM_JON FAVREAU IS PROBABLY NOT THE GUY THAT I WOULD HIRE IF I WAS LOOKING FOR A DIRECTOR FOR AN ACTION MOVIE
15_DELIM_ I MEAN YEAH HES A COMPETENT ACTION DIRECTOR
16_DELIM_HES ACTION SEQUENCES ARE CERTAINLY A LOT BETTER THAN THE INCOHERENT IMPOSSIBLE TO FOLLOW SLOPE THAT WE SEE IN A TYPICAL MICHAEL BAY MOVIE
17_DELIM_BUT ITS ACTION ISNT PARTICULARY MEMORABLE
18_DELIM_AND THE ACTION WASNT THE MOST MEMORABLE THING ABOUT ANY ON THOSE MOVIES
19_DELIM_THE IRONMAN FILMS ARE FONDLY REMEMBERED MOSTLY FOR ROBERT DOWENY JR NOT THE ACTION
20_DELIM_AND THE SAME THING HAS MORE OR LESS HAPPENED HERE YEAH THATS RIGHT
21_DELIM_THE MOVIE CALLED COWBOYS AND ALIENS DANIEL CRAIG STEELS THE WHOLE DAMN SHOW
22_DELIM_HES PLAYING A VARIATION OF THE ICONIC MAN WITH NO NAME CHARACTER THAT WAS MADE FAMOUS BY CLINT EASTWOOD 
23_DELIM_AND NOW THAT IVE SEEN HIM IN THE ROLE I CANT IMAGINE ANY OTHER CURRENT ACTOR TRYING OT PULL IT OFF
24_DELIM_HE IS PERFECT FROM START TO FINSIH
25_DELIM_ HARISSON FORD IS A LONG FOR THE RIDE AND HAVING A BLAST AS THE SECOND LEAD
26_DELIM_AND THE CAST IS PRETTY WELL ROUNDED OUT WITH SUPPORDTING PERFORMANCE FROM GUYS LIKE SAM ROCKWELL AS THE DOC
27_DELIM_THEYRE ALL PLAYING CLICHED STOCK WESTERN CHARACTERS
28_DELIM_BUT I REALLY DONT CARE THAT THE CHARACTERS ARE WALKING CLICHES WHEN THEY ARE THIS WELL DONE 
29_DELIM_AND THE ACTORS DO SUCH A GOOD JOB OF CARRYING OF THEIR PARTICULAR ARCS
30_DELIM_ COWBOYS AND ALIENS PROBLEM IS THE SCREENPLAY
31_DELIM_SIX DIFFERENT PEOPLE GOT WRITING CREDIT FOR THIS MOVIE AND THE RESULTS ARE EXACTLY WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT
