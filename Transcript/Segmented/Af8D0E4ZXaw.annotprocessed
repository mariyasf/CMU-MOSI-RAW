1_DELIM_I CANT EXPRESS MY THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS ABOUT THIS MOVIE ADEQUATLY WITHOUT DESCRIBING SOME SPECIFIC THINGS IN THE THIRD ACT OF THE MOVIE
2_DELIM_IT WAS WIDELY BELIEVED THAT A SUCESS OF GREEN LANTERN MOVIE WOULD LEAD WARNER BROTHERS TO ADAPT THE FLASH AND WONDER WOMAN AMONG POSSIBLY OTHERS 
3_DELIM_AND PUT THEM IN A JUSTICE LEAGE MOVIE WITH THE RITUAL BATMAN AND SUPERMAN
4_DELIM_SO NOT ONLY THAT THIS MOVIE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE BURDEN OF TELLING ITS OWN SELFCONTAINED STORY AND SETTING UP ITS OWN INEVITABLE SEQUELS
5_DELIM_ IT HAD TO DEAL WITH THE EXPECTATIONS OF POTENTIALLY SETTING UP ALL THAT OTHERS STUFF
6_DELIM_YEAH NOT GOOD
7_DELIM_TO ALL THE GREEN LANTERN FANS OUT THERE I AM SO SORRY
8_DELIM_I SAY THAT FOR TWO REASONS FIRST BECAUSE SOMEONE OWES YOU AN APPOLOGIE 
9_DELIM_AND WARNER BROTHERS IS NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU ONE
10_DELIM_AND SECONDLY BECAUSE AS A MARVELL GEEK I HAVE EXPERIENCED MY FAIR SHARE OF DISAPPOINTMENTS OVER THE LAST DECADE AND I CAN GENUINLY SYMPHATIZE WITH YOU
11_DELIM_BEFORE I GET TO THE NEGATIVES OF THE MOVIE LET ME LIST OFF A FEW OF THE POSITIVES
12_DELIM_ I LOVE JEFFREY RUSH AND MICHAEL CLARKE DUNCAN AS THE VOICE ACTORS
13_DELIM_ THEY DO A GREAT JOB WITH THEIR ROLES
14_DELIM_THEY ARE GREAT ADDITIONS
15_DELIM_ I ALSO LOVE THE CASTING OF MARK STRONG AS SINESTRO
16_DELIM_HES PERFECT FOR THAT ROLE
17_DELIM_ AND UM FINALLY A PARTICULAR STAND OUT SCENE FOR ME WAS THE FIGHTER JET SEQUENCE
18_DELIM_IT WAS BY FAR MY FAVORITE ACTION SEEN IN THE MOVIE
19_DELIM_I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY WELL PUT TOGETHER
20_DELIM_AND UM I THOUGHT IT WORKED WORKED PRETTY WELL
21_DELIM_ UM AND IN FACT IN SPITE OF ALL THE NEGATIVES IM ABOUT TO MENTION I THOUGHT THE MOVIE WAS WORKING FOR A WHILE FOR ABOUT THE FIRST THIRD UM BUT AT THE END OF ACT ONE TWO SIGNIFICANT THINGS HAPPENED
22_DELIM_HACTOR HUMMAND ARRIVES AND STARTS CHEWING SCENERY LIKE ITS A TWO DOLLAR STEAK
23_DELIM_AND HOW JORDAN FLIES OFF TO THE GREEN LANTERN CORE PLANET OH AND THE MOVIE STARTS SEQUEL BAITING
24_DELIM_THESE TWO DEVELOPMENTS TOGETHER CAUSED WHAT WAS UP TO THAT POINT A NOBLE EFFORT TO START FALLING APART AT THE SEAMS
25_DELIM_ AND IT WAS PAINFUL TO WATCH
26_DELIM_I DONT EVEN KNOW WHY I REALLY SHOULD BEGIN WITH LISTING OFF THE NEGATIVES BUT IM GOING TO START WITH A FEW OF THE SUPERFICIAL THINGS
27_DELIM_THE ACTING RANGES FROM MEDIOCRITY TO HAMFISTED FROM THE LIVE ACTION ACTORS
28_DELIM_BUT I CANT REALLY BLAME THEM FOR THAT 
29_DELIM_ THIS IS STAR WARS PREQUAL TERRITORY
30_DELIM_THE ACTING IS NOT THAT BAD
31_DELIM_BUT STILL ITS THAT KIND OF MOVIE MAKING
