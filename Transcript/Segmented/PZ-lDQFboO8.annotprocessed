1_DELIM_I WAS A LITTLE BIT DISAPPOINTED IN THE FILM
2_DELIM_BUT THE MOVIE ITSELF WAS JUST A LITTLE DRY
3_DELIM_IT DIDNT HAVE A WHOLE OUT OF HUMOR GOING ON WITH IT AT LEAST NONE THAT REALLY MADE YOU WANNA LAUGH OUT LOUD
4_DELIM_UM EVEN THE KIDS AND THE AUDIENCE ITSELF JUST KIND OF CHUCKLED A LITTLE BIT GAVE A FEW LAUGHS
5_DELIM_NOW IM NOT GONNA LIE THERERE A FEW PARTS THAT HAVE GREAT ACTION SEQUENCES NOW EVEN THOUGH IT IS AN ANIMATED FILM IT DID HAVE SOME GREAT FIGHT SCENES
6_DELIM_UM BUT AS FAR AS HUMOR GOES NOT AS MUCH AS I WAS EXPECTING
7_DELIM_EVERYTHING YOU SEE IN THE TRAILER ITSELF WAS PRETTY MUCH ALL THE HUMOR YOURE GONNA SEE IN THE MOVIE
8_DELIM_UM UM A YOU KNOW ALONG WITH THE XXX I WOULD PROBABLY SAYING GO SEE THIS MOVIE AN EARLY SHOWING DONT SPEND A LOT OF MONEY FOR THE NIGHT VIEWING
9_DELIM_UM MAYBE BETTER LIKE NEXT TIME DREAMWORKS BUT FOR THIS ONE FOR ME IT JUST WASNT WHAT I WAS HOPING IT WOULD BE
10_DELIM_I LOVE THE SHREK FILMS
11_DELIM_I LIKED ANTS
12_DELIM_BUT AS FAR AS KUNG FU PANDA GOES I WAS HOPING FOR A LOT MORE IT JUST WASNT THERE FOR ME I DONT KNOW
