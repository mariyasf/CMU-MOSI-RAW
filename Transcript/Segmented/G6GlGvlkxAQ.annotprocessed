1_DELIM_ I WOULD PUT MONEY ON IT THAT IT IS GOING TO BE THE BLOCKBUSTER HIT OF THE SUMMER IN TERMS OF WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL THE MOVIES

10_DELIM_UM GREAT MOVIE OVERALL
11_DELIM_ THEY DID VERY WELL TO ESTABLISH THE CHARACTER OF THOR
12_DELIM_THE PROBLEM WITH A LOT OF COMIC BOOK SHOWS AND MOVIES
13_DELIM_AND YOU SAW THIS WITH THE NBC RECENT FLOP OF THE CAPE WHICH IS A SHOW I LOVE 
14_DELIM_BUT THE AUDIENCE THAT WAS WATCHING IT THEY NEEDED THEY NEEDED A PAY OFF RIGHT AWAY
15_DELIM_AND THEY NEEDED CHARACTER ESTABLISHED RIGHT AWAY
16_DELIM_UM WHAT YOU GET IN THE SITCOMS IN TERMS OF COMIC BOOKS AND KIND OF THE MOVIES THAT TAKE SO LOUD TO BUILD THAT
