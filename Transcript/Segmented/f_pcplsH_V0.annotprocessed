1_DELIM_SO YOU BETTER APPRECIATE THIS REVIEW
2_DELIM_BUT TO ANY OF YOU WHO ARE I EXPECT A THUMBS UP
3_DELIM_THEYRE BACK TO YOU HAVING TWO KILLERS THANKFULLY
4_DELIM_BECAUSE IT DOES MAKE A LOT MORE SENSE HAVING THE KILLER BE ABLE TO BE EVERYWHERE IF THERES TWO OF THEM
5_DELIM_HMPH MY OVERALL OPINION OF THE RESULTS OF THIS PROCESS ARE ITS BETTER THAN SCREAM 3
6_DELIM_ AND ACTUALLY IS BETTER THAN SCREAM 2
7_DELIM_ A LOT OF PEOPLE DONT LIKE SCREAM 2
8_DELIM_I THINK ITS HIGHLY UNDERRATED
9_DELIM_ I HATED SCREAM 3
10_DELIM_BUT I THINK THIS ONE DID BEAT SCREAM 2
11_DELIM_ NOW I DIDNT REALLY LIKE THE FIRST HOUR THAT MUCH THOUGH
12_DELIM_ IM SURE YOU ALL REMEMBER THE STAB MOVIES THAT WERE BASED ON THE SCREAM MOVIES OR THE EXPERIENCES OF SIDNEY IN UNIVERSE SO THAT PEOPLE COULD COMMENT ON THE KILLERS REENACTING THE MOVIES OR FOLLOWING UP THE MOVIES WELL IN THE FIRST HOUR THOSE BECOME WAY WAY WAY TOO MUCH OF A PLOT POINT BASICALLY
13_DELIM_ I THINK XXX I WANT TO SEE IT
14_DELIM_BUT IT ACTUALLY BASICALLY MAKES THE CHARACTERS CONGITION NOT JUST OF THE GENRE WITHIN WHICH THEY ARE IN BUT OF THEIR OWN FRANCHISE TO A RIDICULOUS EXTENT
15_DELIM_IM JUST KINDA LIKE NO THIS IS GOING TO FAR
