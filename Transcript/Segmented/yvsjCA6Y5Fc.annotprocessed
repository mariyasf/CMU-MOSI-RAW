6_DELIM_BUT I DIDNT FIND IT ALL THAT BAD
7_DELIM_I DIDNT FIND IT ALL THAT GOOD 
8_DELIM_LIKE I SAID MAYBE MY EXPECTATIONS WERE LOWERED BECAUSE OF ALL OF THOSE REVIEWS BUT I REALLY DIDNT HATE IT
9_DELIM_LIKE WHAT PEOPLE COULD HATE ABOUT THIS MOVIE THERE ARE SOME NEGATIVES TO SAY THE LEAST
10_DELIM_ UM REALLY FIRST AND FOREMOST IT JUST LACKED THE CHARM OF THESE PAST ROBIN HOOD MOVIES THAT WE KNOW
11_DELIM_THERES MEN IN TIGHTS WHICH YOU KNOW HILARIOUS SPOOF OF THE STORY
12_DELIM_THERES A KEVIN COSTNER PRINCE OF FEE VERSION WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE DARK AND EDGY VERSION OF HIS TIME I MEAN BUT THAT WAS WHAT THIRTEEN YEARS AGO FOURTEEN YEARS AGO PROBABLY MORE THAN THAT
13_DELIM_AND IT JUST LACKED THE CHARM OF THOSE PAST MOVIES
14_DELIM_ IT DID SEEM TO FOCUS TOO MUCH ON EPIC EPIC EPIC 
15_DELIM_AND IT REALLY JUST LACKED WHAT MADE THE OTHER MOVIES MORE ENJOYABLE
16_DELIM_AND SUFFERS FROM WHAT I CALL KINGDOM OF HEAVEN SYNDROM WHERE IT BUILDS TOO MUCH FOR THESE HUGE CATASTROPHIC WAR SEQUENCES THEYRE SUPPOSED TO BLOW YOU AWAY BUT THE PROBLEM IS YOU DONT GIVE A DAMN BECAUSE IT JUST LACKS THAT CHARM OF THE PAST MOVIES
17_DELIM_UM NOT IN ALL INSTANCES BUT THE ONES THAT MATTER THE MOST YEAH
