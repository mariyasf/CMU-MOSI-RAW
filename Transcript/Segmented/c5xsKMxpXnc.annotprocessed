3_DELIM_LIKE THEY TALK FOR LIKE FIVE MINUTES AND INSTANTLY KISS WHICH IS DUMB 
4_DELIM_WHAT I LIKED ABOUT THIS MOVIE WAS THE CONCEPT WAS COOL
5_DELIM_BUT THEY DID NOT EXECUTE IT VERY WELL 
6_DELIM_AND THEY LEFT A LOT OF PLOT HOLES
7_DELIM_ THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE FOR THESE REASONS 
8_DELIM_ NUMBER ONE BECAUSE THE LOVE IS FORCED
9_DELIM_ YOU DONT FEEL THAT THESE TWO PEOPLE LOVE EACH OTHER
10_DELIM_AND IT IS VERY RUSHED
11_DELIM_ I MEAN YOU DONT SEE WHY THESE TWO PEOPLE LOVE EACH OTHER
12_DELIM_THERES NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT REALLY WITH THESE TWO
13_DELIM_ LIKE THEY HAVE THEIR OWN SEPARATE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT BUT NONE WHERE THESE TWO SHOULD BE TOGETHER
14_DELIM_ THERES NO REASON WHY THEY SHOULD BE TOGETHER
15_DELIM_YOU DONT SEE WHY THEY SHOULD LIKE EACH OTHER CAUSE THEY DONT SHOW IT IN THE MOVIE
