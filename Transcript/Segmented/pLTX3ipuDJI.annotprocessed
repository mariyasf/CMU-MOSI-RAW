1_DELIM_NOTHING NEW IS BROUGHT IN THOSE PREDATOR SERIES NO SURPRISES NO BIG TWIST NO FINISH
2_DELIM_ I LIKE TO TEASE SOME MYSTERY AND GREAT PLOT WHAT COULDVE BEEN BUT THAN ALL IS EXPLAINED AND DISPPEARES TEN MINUTES LATER ITS JUST A CLEAR REMAKE OF PREDATOR FROM BACK IN 1997 WITH THE PREMISE BEING ALMOST IDENTICAL
3_DELIM_ALTHOUGHT WHAT WASNT THE SAME WAS THE CONNECTION TO EACH OTHER WHICH FIRST MOVIE HAD AND THIS ONE NOT
4_DELIM_ IN THE FIRST RUN THEY WERE A TEAM AND THEY WORKED TOGETHER AND YOU SEE THE PERSONALITES THIS MOVIE JUST POPS A GROUP OF DIFFERENT KILLERS DOWN TOGETHER AND LETS THEM INTERACT POORLY
5_DELIM_YOU DONT SEE ANY OF THE PERSONALITIES WHEN ONE DIES YOU DONT MOURN OVER THAM AN YOU DONT GET AN ATTACHMENT TO ANYBODY
6_DELIM_ OF THE ACTING NOTHING STANDS OUT A SPECTACULAR WHICH IS TO BE EXPECTED OF THE MOVIE LIKE THIS
7_DELIM_BUT NOTHING SUCKS EITHER WHICH GAINS THE MOVIE SOME POINTS I GUESS
8_DELIM_WHAT DISAPPOINTED ME WAS THAT ONE OF THE MOST HYPED ACTORS IN THE MOVIE WAS ONLY IN THERE FOR SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME
9_DELIM_AND I KNOW YOU CANT HYPE A MOVIE WITH AN UNKNOWN ACTORS SO EVEN IF SOMEONE IS IN THERE FOR A FEW MINUTES YOU SHOULD HYPE THEM
10_DELIM_ BUT ITS JUST A LITTLE WEAK OVERALL FOR ME THAN WE WERE LOOKING FORWARD TO HIM AND HE WAS GONE QUICKLY
11_DELIM_ALTHOUGH WHAT IT DID DO WAS INTERESTING BUT I BUT IT DIDNT MAKE SENSE
12_DELIM_ HE CO LAURENCE FISHBURNE COMES IN AND TELLS THE CHARACTERS THINGS THAT ONLY SCREEN WRITERS SHOULDVE KNOWN ABOUT WHICH GIVES A LITTLE MORE OF F FONY FEEL THIS WHOLE THING
13_DELIM_ JUST LIKE ONE OF THE GIRLS TELLS THE EXACT STORY OF THE FIRST MOVIE
14_DELIM_ITS A POINTLESS SCENE FOR THE AUDIENCE AND THE CHARACTERS
15_DELIM_IT DOSENT GIVE AN GIVE ANY INSIGHT OR HELP ITS JUST MAKE THEM SEEM LIKE SHE SA SHE SAW THE FIRST MOVIE
16_DELIM_IN FINALE I WOULD ONLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE FOR A RENTAL NON IN THEATER BECAUSE ITS A LOW GRADE SEQUAL TO THE 87TH VERSION AND ONLY IF YOU LIKE THE SERIES
