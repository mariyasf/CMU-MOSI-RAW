1_DELIM_BECAUSE IM STILL EXCITED ABOUT IT
2_DELIM_ AS SOME OF YOU MIGHT NOT NOTICE I WAS EXTREMLY EXCITED ABOUT SAW 5
3_DELIM_ OK ALL OF YOU KNEW THAT OBVIOUSLY
4_DELIM_SO I WAS YOU KNOW REALLY HYPED UP
5_DELIM_AND EXCITED TO SEE IT 
6_DELIM_AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT IT WAS DEFINATELY BETTER THAN THE SAW 4
7_DELIM_NOT EXECTLY WHAT I WAS EXPECTING 
8_DELIM_BUT IT WAS STILL REALLY REALLY REALLY GOOD
9_DELIM_AND UM ITS JUST MADE ME REALLY REALLY EXCIDED FOR SAW 6
10_DELIM_ ONE OF THEM WAS GREAT
11_DELIM_AND THE OTHER ONE WAS COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT AS FAR AS I CAN TELL
12_DELIM_THE GREAT PLOT WAS WITH HOFFMAN TYING UP ALL LOOSE ENDS AND STUFF
13_DELIM_AND THE IRRELEVANT PLOT WAS WITH FIVE RENDOM STRANGERS 
14_DELIM_KIND OF LIKE IN SAW 2
15_DELIM_ BUT I TOTALLY MISSED HOW IT TIED IT TO THE MOVIE AT ALL
16_DELIM_AND IM PRETTY SURE THATS BECAUSE IT DIDNT TIE IN TO THE MOVIE AT ALL
17_DELIM_ SO THAT WAS REALLY BIZZARE AND I DIDNT CARE ABOUT THE CHARACTERS AT ALL
18_DELIM_BECAUSE THEY WERENT YOU KNOW INTRODUCED WELL REALLY
19_DELIM_ SO IT WAS JUST REALLY REALLY STRANGE
20_DELIM_BUT LUCKILY HOFFMANS STORY UM WAS A REALLY REALLY REALLY AWESOME 
21_DELIM_AND UM IT TOTALLY MADE UP FOR THAT SO THATS OK
22_DELIM_AND I GUESS THATS SORT OF TRUE
23_DELIM_ BECAUSE I SURE DIDNT SEE THE END COMING
24_DELIM_BUT THE END WAS REALLY YOU YOU KNOW
25_DELIM_BUT I THOUGHT THE BEST PART OF SAW 5 WAS THE STORYLINE LIKE IN GENERAL
26_DELIM_THE ENDING WAS NOT YOU KNOW CRAZY SHOCKING OR ANYTHING LIKE USUAL
27_DELIM_IT WAS NOT A REAL HUGE SAW TWIST MOMENT
28_DELIM_UM SO YOU KNOW THAT WAS A LITTLE SURPRISING I GUESS
29_DELIM_ THATS NOT TO SAY THAT THE ENDING WASNT GOOD BECAUSE IT REALLY WAS 
30_DELIM_BUT IT WAS NOT EXECTLY WHAT I WAS EXPECTING AND SE SERIOUSLY EVERYTHING LEADING UP TO THE END WAS BETTER THAN THE ENDING 
31_DELIM_WHICH IS STILL GOOD
32_DELIM_BECAUSE THE MOVIE IS GOOD
33_DELIM_ SAW 5 HAS LEFT LIKE NO CLOSURE AT ALL AT THE END OF THE MOVIE
34_DELIM_AND IT PRETTY MUCH JUST LEFT THE DOOR WIDE OPEN FOR SAW 6 
35_DELIM_BUT MAN OH MAN IT REALLY LEFT THE DOOR OPEN
36_DELIM_AND IT DIDNT EVEN YOU KNOW TRY TO CLOSE IT AT ALL LIKE THE WIND ISNT GONNA BLOW IT OVER OR ANYTHING ITS JUST OPEN
37_DELIM_BUT LIKE I SAID THE PLOT OF HOFFMAN AND EVERYTHING THAT WAS REALLY REALLY AWESOME 
38_DELIM_AND IT FIT VERY WELL INTO THE SAW SERIES IN MY OPINION
39_DELIM_SO CONGRATULATIONS TO THE WRITERS FOR THAT
40_DELIM_ BUT ILL SMACK THEM IN THE FACE FOR THE OTHER IRRELEVANT PLOTLINE
41_DELIM_AND DONT KNOW WHAT THE HELL THEY WERE THINKING
42_DELIM_IT WAS PRETTY MUCH JUST AND EXCUSE TO PUT TRAPS IN THE MOVIE BECAUSE IT WAS LITERALLY COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT
43_DELIM_LIKE I SAID I LOVED THE HOFFMANS STORYLINE 
44_DELIM_SO YOU KNOW I GUESS IT BALANCES OUT
