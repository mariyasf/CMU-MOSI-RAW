1_DELIM_IM A BIG FAN OF THE FIRST TRON
2_DELIM_UM I THOUGHT THIS IS THE PERFECT TIME TO HAVE A TRON SEQUEL
3_DELIM_BECAUSE UM IN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 1980S PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT COMPUTERS CAN DO EVERY EVERY ANYTHING 
4_DELIM_AND EVERYTHING AND NOW TECHNOLOGY ACTUALLY DOES ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING
5_DELIM_BECAUSE IT KINDA CONTROLS OUR LIVES SO IT WAS THE PERFECT TIME FOR A TRON SEQUEL
6_DELIM_UNFORTUNATELY UM THE WRITERS AND I WERE NOT EXACTLY ON THE SAME WAVELENGTH
7_DELIM_LIP SMACKING BUT I WILL SAY THAT THE FIRST THIRD OF THIS MOVIE IS AMAZING
8_DELIM_ITS THE BEST SUMMER MOVIE IVE SEEN ALL YEAR
9_DELIM_ BUT YOU KNOW THE PACING IS SO GOOD
10_DELIM_ IT GETS STRAIGHT INTO THE STORY
11_DELIM_YOU HAVE LOTS OF UH REFERENCES TO THE FIRST MOVIE
12_DELIM_YOU HAVE NEW CHARACTERS THAT ACTUALLY HAVE A CONNECTION TO THE OLD ONES
13_DELIM_AND ONCE SAM FLYNN ENTERS THE GRID YOU KNOW THE SOUNDTRACK DRAWS YOU IN
14_DELIM_THE SPECIAL EFFECTS LOOK AMAZING
15_DELIM_UH THEY DONT WASTE A LOT OF TIME ON EXPOSITION
16_DELIM_BECAUSE THE MINUTE THE SOUNDPLANE ENTERS THE GRID HE IS PUT IN THE GAMES
17_DELIM_AND LET ME TELL YOU THE GAMES LOOK GREAT
18_DELIM_ALL THOSE ACTION SEQUENCES IN INVOLVING THE GAMES WERE GREAT TO WATCH
19_DELIM_UM THE CHO THE CHOREOGRAPHY OF THE FIGHTS THE SPECIAL EFFECTS I WAS SO HAPPY TO BE BACK IN THE GRID THAT I WASNT REALLY THINKING ABOUT THE STORY OR WHERE THE STORY WAS GOING
20_DELIM_BUT THEN SAM FLYNN MEETS HIS FATHER AND TRON BASICALLY TURNS INTO A STAR WARS PREQUEL AFTER THAT ONE
21_DELIM_ DISCONNECTION THEN THAT HAPPENS AT THAT POINT
22_DELIM_THE WRITERS JUST PULL THIS OUT OF THEIR ASS
23_DELIM_ AND THE WHOLE MOVIE BECOMES ABOUT THESE CRAZY I I ISOS 
24_DELIM_AND ITS JUST LIKE OR WHY DO WE NEED THESE THINGS 
25_DELIM_IT DOESNT MAKE ANY SENSE 
26_DELIM_BECAUSE WHEN THE OLD FLYNN FINDS THESE THINGS WHATEVER THEY ARE THEYRE SO WISE AND NAIVE KINDA LIKE NAVI NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT
27_DELIM_CLUE WHICH IS THE PROGRAM THAT HE CREATED IN THE FIRST MOVIE KINDA PULLS A BUNNY IN THE BOILER MOMENT IN THE SENSE THAT HE TURNS INTO A CRAZY JEALOUS PSYCHO STALKER BITCH
28_DELIM_AND CLUE HAS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST IDIOTIC VILLAINS EVER CAUSE WHAT IS A WHAT IS CLUE
29_DELIM_FOR SOME KIND OF FREAKY TELEPORTATION
30_DELIM_AND ITS LIKE YOURE A COMPUTER PROGRAM OKAY IF YOU WANT TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD USING REAL PEOPLE ITS THE WORST WAY YOU COULD POSSIBLY DO THAT INFILTRATE SOME COMPUTER SYSTEM SOMEWHERE AND DETONATE SOME NUKES OR SOMETHING
