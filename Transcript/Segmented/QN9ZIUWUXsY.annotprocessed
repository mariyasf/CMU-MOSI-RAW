1_DELIM_ MAIN DRAW FOR ME FOR THIS MOVIE WAS JUST THE FACT THAT ITS SET IN THIS LIKE RIDICULOUS WORLD WITH ALL THESE BRIGHT BEAUTIFUL COLORS AND RIDICULOUS ACTION SEQUENCES
2_DELIM_AND I DONT THINK THATS A VERY GOOD MOVIE 
3_DELIM_BUT I DO THINK ITS A VERY INTERESTING ONE
4_DELIM_ I CAN TELL YOU THAT TRON LEGACY IS NOT A GOOD MOVIE
5_DELIM_BUT I WAS STILL RIDICILOUSLY ENTERTAINED BY IT
6_DELIM_ARE THESE TWO THINGS POSSIBLE IN THE SAME SENTANCEI I REALLY DO THINK SO
7_DELIM_TRON LEGACY IS A MOVIE WHERE ON MOST COUNTS THAT I JUDGE MOVIES IT KIND OF FAILS
8_DELIM_THE PERFORMANCES ARE NAH
9_DELIM_ THE SCRIPT CAN BE HORRIBLE
10_DELIM_ ITS ITS A BIT OF A MIXED BAG COZ THERE WERE SOME VERY BRIGHT MOMENTS
11_DELIM_UM THE DIRECTION IS A BIT ITS WOBBLY
12_DELIM_BASICALLY A LOT OF ELEMENTS THAT I COULD TAKE A MOVIE ON ITS REALLY WOBBLY
13_DELIM_ BUT WHAT IT LACKS IN THOSE AREAS IT MOST DEFINATELY MAKES UP FOR JUST LIKE SHEER VISUAL SPECTACLE
14_DELIM_I MEAN THIS MOVIE HAS THE MOST GORGEOUS VISUALS OUT OF ANY MOVIES SINCE PROBABLY AVATAR ME IF NOT PRETTIER
15_DELIM_SO MANY MOMENTS IN THIS MOVIE THAT ARE JUST FRAMED AND LIT SO PERFECTLY THAT SO THAT YOU JUST GO LIKE KIND OF HUH THATS REALLY REALLY COOL
16_DELIM_ AND THEN TAKE THAT WORLD THAT HAVE BEEN SET LIKE A CRAP TUNNEL OF REALLY KINETIC REALLY WELL DONE ACTION SEQUENCES IN IT AND YOU HAVE TRON LEGACY
17_DELIM_IT IT DOESNT MAKE MUCH SENSE I KNOW
18_DELIM_AND BASICALLY THIS MAKES NO SENSE
