1_DELIM_ I DONT REALLY KNOW I DONT ITS SO WEIRD
2_DELIM_I THERE WERE TIMES IN THE MOVIE WHERE I FELT REALLY BORED
3_DELIM_AND THERE WERE TIMES THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY
4_DELIM_AND THERE WERE TIMES THAT I WAS JUST SITTING THERE AFTER THEY SAID THEIR JOKES AND I WAS LIKE THATS NOT NOBODYS LAUGHING THATS NOT FUNNY
5_DELIM_I JUST DONT THINK IT WAS VERY GOOD
6_DELIM_AND THIS IS THE THING FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS AND NO STRINGS ATTACHED THEY ARE THE SAME MOVIE DIFFERENT WAYS OF GETTING TO THE SAME POINT BUT ITS THE SAME POINT
7_DELIM_SO I THINK THAT NO STRINGS ATTACHED WAS BETTER THAN FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS
8_DELIM_I WAS NOT BORED DURING NO STRINGS ATTACHED
9_DELIM_I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY FUNNY 
10_DELIM_UM AND UH FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS HAD ITS MOMENTS
11_DELIM_BUTSIGH IT HAD A LOT OF REALLY BAD MOMENTS
12_DELIM_AND HE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE ACTORS EVER
13_DELIM_ HE IS BRILLIANT THERE IS NOT A MOVIE THAT I SEE HIM IN THAT I DONT END UP CRYING BECAUSE HE IS SO FANTASTIC AND HE JUST BREAKS YOUR HEART WHENEVER HE DOES YOU KNOW A ROLE THAT USUALLY HIS ROLES DO BREAK YOUR HEART AT SOME POINT SO DEFINITELY DID IN THIS MOVIE
14_DELIM_I LIKE TEARED UP IN FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS BECAUSE OF HIM
15_DELIM_ THE LADY WHO PLAYS JUSTIN TIMBERLAKES SISTER UM I THOUGHT SHE WAS VERY GOOD IN THIS MOVIE
16_DELIM_AND I THOUGHT SHE WAS JUST LIKE REALLY NATURAL AND FUNNY
17_DELIM_AND SHE LOOKS LIKE RENEE ZELLWEGGER AND HELEN HUNT FROM A TWISTER MOVIE
18_DELIM_AND SHE TALKS LIKE HER TOO
19_DELIM_IT WAS WEIRD
20_DELIM_ THE WHOLE TIME I SAW HER ALL I THOUGHT WAS HELEN HUNT AND RENEE ZELLWEGGER
21_DELIM_ANOTHER THING WAS THE FACT THAT THERE WAS NOT ONE HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP OR POSITIVE GOOD RELATIONSHIP IN THIS WHOLE MOVIE
22_DELIM_BUT THATS KIND OF DEPRESSING
