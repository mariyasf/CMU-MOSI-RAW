1_DELIM_AND THIS IS THE ONE THAT I CAN SAY WAS DEFINATELLY DISAPPOINTED
2_DELIM_I LOVE THE FIRST SHREK AND THE SECOND SHREK
3_DELIM_AND I WAS REALLY HOPING THAT THIS ONE BE JUST AS GOOD 
4_DELIM_AND IT JUST THAT IT HADNT ANYTHING NEW TO OFFER
5_DELIM_I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THAT
6_DELIM_ I MEAN I WENT IN THERE HOPING TO SEE SOMETHING ORIGINAL AND FUNNY LIKE THE FIRST TWO
7_DELIM_AND IT OFFERED NOTHING OF THE SUCH
8_DELIM_ IT WASNT REMOTLY FUNNY
9_DELIM_THERE WAS A FEW JOKES OK YEAH MAKE YOU GIGGLE OR SOMETHING
10_DELIM_BUT THATS NOTHING MAJOR 
11_DELIM_NOTHING REALLY THAT FUNNY
12_DELIM_ OR ANYTHING ORIGINAL
13_DELIM_THE CHARACTERS ARE ALL THE SAME 
14_DELIM_AND NOT EVEN AS GOOD AS THE FIRST TWO MOVIES
15_DELIM_AND I LOVED PUSS IN BOOTS
16_DELIM_AND HE WASNT EVEN THAT GREAT THIS TIME AROUND
17_DELIM_THE DONKEY AND PUSS IN BOOTS RIVALRY THATS GOING ON IT JUST IT WASNT AS FUNNY THE THIRD TIME AROUND 
18_DELIM_AND THERE WAS NOTHING NEW TO OFFER
19_DELIM_ PLAIN AND SIMPLY IT WAS DULL FOR ME
20_DELIM_ IT COULDVE BEEN SO MUCH BETTER I I COULDVE I SAW IT BEING SO MUCH BETTER IN MY HEAD BUT IT JUST WASNT
21_DELIM_IT DISAPPOINTED ME HIGHLY
22_DELIM_AND I WAS JUST SORT OF DISCOURAGED AFTER SEEING THE MOVIE 
23_DELIM_AND IM DEFINATELLY WISH I HAD MY MONEY BACK
24_DELIM_UM IT WAS A WASTE OF MY TIME
25_DELIM_AND I DONT SUGGEST ANYONE GO SEE IT
26_DELIM_ IF YOURE HOPING TO IF YOU HAVE TO HAVE IF YOU HAVE KIDS AND YOURE FORCED TO GO WHICH YOU PROBABLY WILL IF YOU HAVE KIDS YOU KNOW PUT UP WITH IT AS A PARENT 
27_DELIM_ BUT ON YOUR OWN DONT GO SEE IT
28_DELIM_ITS NOT REALLY THAT GREAT
29_DELIM_EVERYONE IS SPLIT ON THIS ONE JUST AS THEY WERE ON SPIDERMAN
30_DELIM_AND JUST THEY ARE WITH ALL THE OTHER SEQUELS THAT ARE COMING OUT AN THIS ONE
31_DELIM_I HAVE TO AGREE ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE IT WAS NOT GREAT
32_DELIM_ IT WASNT EVEN REMOTELY GOOD
33_DELIM_ I MEAN THERES A FEW MOMENTS YEAH THAT ARE ORIGINAL AND FUNNY
34_DELIM_AND THERES A NE AN INTRODUCTION OF A NEW CHARACTER JUSTINE TIMBERLAKES CHARACTER ALREADY IN THE FILM 
35_DELIM_BUT THEY DIDNT EVEN GIVE HIM THAT MUCH TO DO THE HE HAD ONLY FEW MINOR LINES
36_DELIM_AND NONE OF THEM WERE REALLY THAT GREAT I MEAN STANDS OUT IN YOUR MIND
37_DELIM_SO THE ADDITION OF THIS CHARACTER WAS PRETTY POINTLESS
38_DELIM_I MEAN ITS PLEASENT TO THE STORY
39_DELIM_BUT I STILL FIND IT POINTLESS IN THE END OF THE MOVIE
40_DELIM_AND THE CHARACTERS JUST WERENT THE SAME AS THE FIRST TWO THAT I FELL IN LOVE WITH THEM
41_DELIM_IT JUST KIND OF MADE ME WANNA REALLY WALK OUT OF THE THEATER
42_DELIM_SO THAT JUST PISSED ME OFF MORE 
43_DELIM_BUT REALLY I COULDVE SHOULDVE JUST WALKED UP AND LEFT AT THAT MOMENT
44_DELIM_ IT WAS BORING
45_DELIM_AND NOT AT ALL ORIGINAL IN MY OPINION
46_DELIM_IT COULDVE BEEN SO MUCH BETTER 
47_DELIM_ THAN THE SECOND SEQUEL WAS REALLY GREAT
48_DELIM_AND I LOVED IT AND THIS ONE JUST WAS A FLAT OF DISAPPOINTMENTS
49_DELIM_SO IM GONNA RATE THIS ONE TWO STARS
50_DELIM_IT SHOULDVE REALLY BE ONE
51_DELIM_BUT IM GONNA GIVE IT A TWO TO BE FAIR 
52_DELIM_BECAUSE THE MOVIE DID HAVE SOME POINTS WHEN I WAS LAUGHING
53_DELIM_BUT VERY FEW
54_DELIM_AND IT WASNT WORTH IT IN MY OPINION TO GO SEE IT
55_DELIM_ SO I DEFINATELLY SUGGEST
