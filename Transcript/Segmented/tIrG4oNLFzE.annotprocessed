1_DELIM_ NOW I AM A HUGE HUGE FAN OF NICHOLAS SPARKS
2_DELIM_UM THE NOTEBOOK IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE FILMS
3_DELIM_UM I REALLY ENJOYED A WALK TO REMEMBER ME AND DEAR JOHN
4_DELIM_I REALLY DID ENJOY AS WELL WASNT TOO FOND OF THE ENDING
5_DELIM_SO I WENT INTO THIS FILM HAVING QUITE HIGH EXPECTATIONS
6_DELIM_I MEAN ITS A NICHOLAS SPARKS BOOK IT MUST BE GOOD
7_DELIM_BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I WAS REALLY UM WARY OF GOING
8_DELIM_LIKE WHAT TO EXPECT FROM MILEY CYRUS UM I MEAN SHES ONLY DONE THE HANNAH MONTANA FRANCHISE PLAYING THAT ONE CHARACTER WHICH I THINK LIKE 99 OF THE PERCENT OF THE TIME HER CHARACTERS LIKE SO OVERBOARD SHES SO EXAGGERATED SO I REALLY DIDNT KNOW HOW SHE WAS GOING TO HANDLE THIS FILM
9_DELIM_STRAIGHT AWAY MILEY CYRUS ACTING MILEY CYRUS ACTING OR LACK OF SHE HAD THIS SAME EXPRESSION THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE FILM
10_DELIM_ IT WAS LIKE THIS LIKE POUTY LIKE GRUMPY LOOK
11_DELIM_AND THEN MAYBE EVEN WHEN SHE WAS HAPPY LIKE SHE WOULDNT FROWN HER UM FROWN HER EYEBROWS BUT SHED STILL BE POUTY BUT LIKE YEAH LIKE THAT
12_DELIM_WHICH JUST UH IT REALLY ANNOYED ME
13_DELIM_LIKE THOSE THO THOSE THOSE MOMENTS IN THE FILM ESPECIALLY IN THE BEGINNING WHERE SHE WOULD SIT THERE STAND THERE CROSS UM WITH HER ARMS CROSSED AND JUST LOOK OUT INTO THE DISTANCE LIKE JUST LAUGHING WITH THE SAME EXPRESSION OR SHED LOOK ACROSS THE BEACH OR SHED LOOK AT HER DAD OR SHED LOOK AT HER BROTHER WITH THE SAME EXPRESSION AND I WAS JUST LIKE WHATRE YOU THINKING I I DONT UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS CHARACTERS DOING
14_DELIM_ LIKE OKAY SHES STARING WHATS SHE THINKING HOW DOES SHE FEEL I HAD NO IDEA LIKE IT WAS THE SAME EXPRESSION FOR SHOCK OR FOR SADNESS OR WHAT I PRESUMED SHED BE SAD BUT IT SIGH IT REALLY BUGGED ME
15_DELIM_BUT AS AN ACTOR I REALLY THINK ESPECIALLY AN ACTOR IN THE LEAD LEADING ROLE YOU REALLY SHOULD PREPARE FOR THAT ROLE
16_DELIM_I WAS LIKE HOW CAN YOU GO INTO A FILM INTO A LEADING ROLE AND HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOUR CHARACTER IS
17_DELIM_SMACKING SO THATS PROBABLY WHY SHE JUST LAUGHINGLOOKED THE SAME IN EVERY SINGLE SCENE THERE WAS PROBABLY ABOUT TWO SCENES THAT I ACTUALLY THOUGHT YEA SHE THIS IS HER ACTING THIS IS GOOD SHE CAN DO THIS
18_DELIM_BUT THEN THOSE TWO MOMENTS JUST GOT RUINED BY THE REST OF AN HOUR AND A HALF OF HER BEING POUTY
