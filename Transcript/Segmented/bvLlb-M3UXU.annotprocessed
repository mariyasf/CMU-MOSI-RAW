1_DELIM_AND ITS REALLY WHAT YOU WOULDVE EXPACT
2_DELIM_ITS NOT A COMPELLING NARRATIVE BY ANY MEANS
3_DELIM_THERES LITTLE TO NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT ALL MOVIE
4_DELIM_AND YET THIS MOVIE IS INCREDIBLY ENJOYABLE FOR ACTION FANS 
5_DELIM_AND REALLY THERES NO HUMONGOUS TALE TO THESE GUYS 
6_DELIM_NOT A COMPLICATED STORY
7_DELIM_BUT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DONT NEED A COMPLECATED FORMULA FOR AN ACTION MOVIE
8_DELIM_ THERES A BAD GUY GUY GO TAKE HIM DOWN THATS REALLY ALL YOU NEED
9_DELIM_THIS MOVIE ESSENTIALLY WAS MADE FOR THREE REASONS IN MY OPINION
10_DELIM_THE FIRST REASON IS THE OBVIOUS JUST TO MAKE AN EXCITING ENJOYABLE ACTION FILM
11_DELIM_ AND THATS YOU KNOW ALL THATS ALL YOU REALLY NEEDED TO DO
12_DELIM_ AND DEFINATELLY COMES THROUGH ON THAT
13_DELIM_ THE SECOND REASON THIS MOVIE WAS MADE AND IN MY OPINION THE REAL REASON IT WAS MADE AGAIN ITS SILVESTRE STALONE TELLING HIMSELF I STILL GOT IT
14_DELIM_ UM IVE GOT TO GIVE HIM CREDIT
15_DELIM_HES IN TERRIFIC SHAPE FOR A MAN TWICE MY AGE WHO LOOKS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN ME 
16_DELIM_THATS KIND OF MADE ME FEEL DEPRESSED 
17_DELIM_BUT HEY WHATEVER AND IS SHOWING YEAH MAYBE HES NOT WHAT HE WAS TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO BUT HE STILL HAS EVERY RIGHT TO BE BILLED AS AN ACTION STAR
18_DELIM_THERES ACTUALLY YEAH YEAH SCENES TRIPLE STAND OFF WITH SILVESTRE ARNOLD SWARZENEGER BRUCE WILLIS AND YEAH ACTUALLY IN A WAY KIND OF FELL HOLLOW
19_DELIM_BECAUSE YOU KNOW ITS BASICALLY IT WAS STALONE KNOWING THESE GUYS ARENT IN THE SHAPE THEY WERE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO 
20_DELIM_AND I DONT KNOW IF THIS SCENE TOOK PLACE FEFTEEN TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN THOSE GUYS WERE ABSOLUTELY PRIME IT WOULDVE BEEN JUST UM ABSOLUTELY BREATH TAKING MONUMENTAL MOMENT IN CINEMATIC HISTORY
21_DELIM_ BUT SEEING IT TODAY NOW WHEN IT WAS REALLY NOTHING MORE THAN JUST A ONE XXX SHIP 
22_DELIM_IT LOST A LOT OF FEELING
23_DELIM_ IT WASNT THE FINAL YOU KNOW FINALLY HAPPENED U UNITING THAT WE ALL COME TO EXPECT
24_DELIM_IT JUST IT FELT KIND OF CUT AND DRY 
25_DELIM_ WHICH WOULD START THE PLANNING THAT I WISH IT HAS HAPPENED EARLIER IN THEIR CAREERS
