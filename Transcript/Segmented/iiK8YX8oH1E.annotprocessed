1_DELIM_ITS ONE OF THOSE ROMANTIC COMEDIES THAT WE ALL DREAD
2_DELIM_ NOW THE REAL STAR OF SOMETHING BORROWED IS GINNIFER GOODWIN
3_DELIM_ ANNOYINGLY SHE KIND OF YELLS AND SCREAMS THROUGH THE WHOLE MOVIE
4_DELIM_ AND IF YOU CAN TOLERATE HER THE REST OF THE MOVIE ISNT ANY BATTER
5_DELIM_UM IT KIND OF FOLLOWS THE PATH OF MY BEST FRIENDS WEDDING 1997 JULIA ROBERTS MOVIE EXCEPT IT TAKES THIRTY MINUTES LONGER TO DEVIATE FROM THE SCRIPTS OF MY BEST FRIENDS WEDDING
6_DELIM_THERE ARE SOME FUNNY MOMENTS
7_DELIM_ BUT MOSTLY ITS JUST KATE HUDSON BEING VERY ANNOYING
8_DELIM_AND I THINK ITS PREDICTABLE UP AN TO A POINT
9_DELIM_I THINK WITH WITH THESE KIND OF MOVIES WE KIND OF PREDICT
10_DELIM_AND WE SECOND GUESS OURSELVES
11_DELIM_ SO I WILL GIVE IT POINTS FOR NOT BEING EXACTLY LIKE MY BEST FRIENDS WEDDING EVEN AT THE TRAILER SETS IT UP THAT WAY
12_DELIM_ GINNIFER GOODWIN IS FUN TO WATCH 
13_DELIM_BUT I DONT THINK SHES LEADING MATERIAL
14_DELIM_AND LIKE I SAID KATE HUDSON COULDNT BE MORE ANNOYING HERE
15_DELIM_ IF THERE IS ANY SILVERLINING IN THIS MOVIE ITS JOHN KRASINSKI
16_DELIM_WHO I DONT USUALLY LIKE
17_DELIM_BUT HE HAS SOME OF THE FUNNIEST SCENES IN THIS MOVIE
18_DELIM_ HE SEEMS TO BE THE ONLY REALISTIC CHARACTER HERE
