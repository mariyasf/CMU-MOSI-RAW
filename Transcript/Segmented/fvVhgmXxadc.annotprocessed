1_DELIM_IT ONLY HAD THE POTENTIAL TO BE A FILM THAT WAS BOTH PROVKING AND ACTION PACKED
2_DELIM_BUT UNFORTUNATELY ITS JUST AN UGLY WILD VIOLENT UNVOLVING AND SADISTIC EXERCISE
3_DELIM_THAT I GOT VERY LITTLE JOY OUT OF
4_DELIM_IN FACT I GOT MOSTLY PAIN OUT OF IT
5_DELIM_ THATS PRETTY HEAVILY INFERRED IN THE OPENING SEQUENCE 
6_DELIM_WHEN SHE GETS THERE IS FORCED TO NOT ONLY BE TRAPPED IN THE VOCATION THAT SHE OBVIOUSLY DOESNT WANNA BE IN
7_DELIM_NOW IT ALSO TAKES SO REALLY CREEPY XXXOF THE FACT THAT EMILY BROWNING IN THIS MOVIE LOOKS LIKE SHES UNDERAGE
8_DELIM_BUT I DONT KNOW
9_DELIM_THAT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE VIDEO GAME IN A CERTAIN WAY
10_DELIM_IN FACT THE FIRST TIME SHE GOES IN IT LOOKS LIKE A JAPANESE TEMPLE
11_DELIM_AND LATER TIME SHE GOES LIKE A WORLD WAR II BATTLEFIELD UM CASTLE THIS KIND OF PULLED OUT OF LORD OF THE RINGS
12_DELIM_WHATS IN HER MIND WITHIN HER MIND IN A WAY ITS KIND OF LIKE INCEPTION IN THAT WAY
13_DELIM_ITS KIND OF PLAYING WITH THE IDEA WHATS REAL WHATS NOT WHAT THE MATRIX FILMS DID
14_DELIM_ALTHOUGH ACTUALLY THE BEST COMPARISON THIS IS THIS FILM WOULD ACTUALLY BE SOMETHING LIKE PANS LABYRINTH
