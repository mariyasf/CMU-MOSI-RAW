5_DELIM_LIKE THE AVERAGE HORROR FILM THE UNINVITED 
6_DELIM_AND VISUALLY STUNNING 
7_DELIM_ AND I DONT KNOW WHY PEOPLE ARE HATING ON THE FILM BECAUSE I REALLY DO LOVE IT
8_DELIM_OVERALL BROWNING IS JUST FAILS TO DELIVER
9_DELIM_AND IS UPSTAGED BY MANY OTHER PERFORMANCES IN THE FILM
10_DELIM_THE SUPPORTING CAST IS EITHER HIT OR MISS
11_DELIM_THE HITS INCLUDE OSCAR ISAAK AS THE MAIN VILLAIN LIKE I SAID BLUE JENA MALONE IS THE SOFT SPOKEN ROCKET AND THE STEALING ABBY CORNISH IS SWEET PEA A TROUBLED AND RELUCTANT YOUNG WOMAN IN THE PACK
12_DELIM_THE MISSES INCLUDE YOU KNOW VANESSA HUDGENS 
13_DELIM_WHO DOESNT HAVE ANY PRESENTS OR GREATNESS AT ALL
14_DELIM_AND THE OTHER HORRIBLE I MEAN ABSOLUTELY ATROCIOUS CARLA GUGINO AS DOCTOR VERA GORSKI 
15_DELIM_WHOS ACCENT IS SO AWEFUL
16_DELIM_AND WHOS IS RIDICULOUS

18_DELIM_JON HAMM AND SCOTT GLENN COULD BRING YOU KNOW THEY COULD BE INTERESTING CHARACTERS 
19_DELIM_ AND THEY COULD HAVE GREAT BACK STORIES 
20_DELIM_ BUT THEY YOU KNOW THEY THEY BRING NOTHING TO THIS TABLE 
21_DELIM_AND WHICH HURTS THE FILM DRASTICALLY
22_DELIM_BECAUSE THEY ARE INTERESTING CHARACTERS 
23_DELIM_AND COULD HAVE INTERESTING BACK STORIES
24_DELIM_THE ACTING COULD BE BETTER AND IS VERY MEDIO
25_DELIM_THERE IS SOME SORT OF GREATNESS TO SUCKER PUNCH THOUGH
