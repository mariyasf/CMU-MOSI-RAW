1_DELIM_WATCH THIS FUCKING MOVIE
2_DELIM_AND UM PARTICULARLY THE MOVIES THAT I FEEL LIKE SHOULDVE GOTTEN NOMINATED BUT DIDNT AND NEVER LET ME GO IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THOSE MOVIES
3_DELIM_ I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE REALLY SPLIT ABOUT THIS MOVIE
4_DELIM_THERES A CERTAIN DEADPAN NATURE TO IT
5_DELIM_ IT WAS A PRETTY SLOW MOVIE FOR THE MOST PART
6_DELIM_AND IT WAS IT WAS THOUGHFUL
7_DELIM_ BUT THERE ARE YOU KNOW THERERE CRITICS OF MOVIES THAT ARE SOMETIMES TOO THOUGHFUL IN A WAY AND I THINK THAT WOULD NEVER LET ME GO
8_DELIM_ A LOT OF CRITICS SAID THAT IT RELIED TOO MUCH ON THE AUDIENCE TO UM EXPLORE THE THEMES IN THE FILM AND YOU KNOW TIGHTLY SO I GUESS WHICH
9_DELIM_ UM IN A WAY A LOT OF THE THEMES IN NEVER LET ME GO WHICH WERE VERY PROFOUND AND DEEP 
10_DELIM_THEY WERENT FULLY EXPLORED 
11_DELIM_AND I THINK THAT THE MOVIE DID RELY ON YOU TO KIND OF FIGURE IT OUT AND KIND OF DEAL WITH THOSE IDEAS BY YOURSELF
12_DELIM_BUT REGARDLESS I THOUGHT IT WAS A VERY GOOD MOVIE
13_DELIM_THOSE THREE ARE SOME OF THE BEST YOUNG ACTORS OF TODAY

15_DELIM_ AND KEIRA KNIGHTLEY I MEAN EVERYBODY KNOWS HER FROM THE PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN 
16_DELIM_BUT I MEAN IN HER OTHER WORKS LIKE PRIDE AND PREJUDICE SHES JUST BEEN REALY FANTASTIC
17_DELIM_ AND ANDREW GARFIELD OF COURSE EVERYBODY KNOWS HIM FORM THE SOCIAL NETWORK 
18_DELIM_SO LOOK OUT FOR THAT THAT SHOULD BE INTERESTING
